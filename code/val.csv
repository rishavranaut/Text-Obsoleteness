"The phase matching angle makes possible any gain at all in the 0th order. In a collinear setup, choosing the center wavelength allows constant gain up to first order in wavelength. Noncollinear OPAs were developed for an additional degree of freedom, allowing constant gain up to second order in wavelength. The optimal parameters are 4 degrees of noncollinearity, β-barium borate (BBO) as the material, a 400-nm pump wavelength, and signal around 800 nm. This generates a bandwidth three times larger than that of a Ti-sapphire laser amplifier. First-order is mathematically equivalent to some properties of group velocities involved, but this does not mean pump and signal have the same group velocity. After propagation through 1-mm BBO, a short pump pulse no longer overlaps with the signal. Therefore, chirped pulse amplification must be used in situations requiring large gain amplification in long crystals. Long crystals introduce such a large chirp that a compressor is needed anyway. An extreme chirp can lengthen a 20-fs seed pulse to 50 ps, making it suitable for use as the pump. Unchirped 50-ps pulses with high energy can be generated from rare earth-based lasers.","The phase matching angle makes possible any gain at all in the 0th order.

Klein referred to ABC's programs as 'pornography in order to tap into the 1970s moral panic and anxiety over the spread of pornography, using the term to describe the use of female television celebrities moving in loose clothing or underwear in a way that their breasts or buttocks could be seen to move, or 'jiggle'. This was an American invention, used to refer to programs such as Charlie's Angels, Wonder Woman, The Bionic Woman, Three's Company, and WKRP, which used the sexuality of young women as appeal to their audiences.

"Virtue signalling is the expression or promotion of viewpoints that are especially valued within a social group, especially when this is done primarily to enhance the social standing of the speaker. For example, expressing a hatred of the conservative newspaper Daily Mail might be an example of virtue signalling on the British left. The term is chiefly used by commentators to criticize the platitudinous and empty or superficial support of socially progressive views on social media. However, its overuse has rendered it a meaningless political buzzword. Some on the left have embraced the term, blaming virtue signalling for Labour Party's surprise defeat in the 2015 general election, suggesting that the desire to be seen as holding virtuous opinions leads political activists to focus on issues such as nuclear disarmament that are lofty and remote to common voters.","Virtue signalling is the expression or promotion of viewpoints that are especially valued within a social group, especially when this is done primarily to enhance the social standing of the speaker.

"From 1986 to 1993, Rix served as chairman of the Arts Council of Great Britain's Drama Panel, resigning over cuts being made to drama.","==Arts Council Roles==
From 1986 to 1993, Rix served as chairman of the Arts Council of Great Britain's Drama Panel. He was also an active Chair of the Arts Council Disability Committee raising the profile and perceived importance of arts and disability issues within Arts Council decision-making. In these roles he proved dynamic and progressive. 

Before Rix's first budget-setting exercise for the Drama Panel when what was available for all companies was a less than inflation uplift panel members along with others in the Arts Council had wished to fund the British-Asian theatre company Tara Arts, but no-one had ever seen how to source the sum required. Rix however boldly proposed that the biggest national companies were stood still, so releasing money not only to fund Tara, but also allow fresh small-scale developments, and then saw that this was delivered through Panel and Council.<ref> Ian Brown and Rob Brannen, 'When Theatre was for All: the Cork Report, after Ten Years', New Theatre Quarterly, Vol. XII no. 48 1996 , p. 373 </ref> Such willingness to take on the establishment marked his term of office. While maintaining support for national and regional building-based theatre companies, he actively supported the work of small-scale experimental touring companies – including theatre for young people and for the Black and Minority Ethnic communities – and new writing projects. A constant champion of the interests of drama companies and theatre-workers, Rix’s seven-year term of office meant that, even in a period of Thatcherite public-funding stringency, no theatre building for which he had responsibility was closed while the exciting West Yorkshire Playhouse was able to open with vastly increased capacity. Meanwhile the number of touring companies, which had been falling before his arrival, increased from 22 to 33. 

In 1993, the Council at a retreat at Woodstock agreed, in the absence of officers, leaving Rix isolated, that the Drama budget should be disproportionately reduced in the face of across-the-board cuts to the Council’s budget and the money allocated to other less popular art forms. Rix resigned as a matter of principle. This created a negative public reaction and shocked senior Council figures into realising their decision was unacceptable. After a campaign, led behind scenes by his Drama Director Ian Brown and publicly by Drama Panel members, the disproportionate cut was reinstated.<ref> Ian Brown, The road through Woodstock: counter-Thatcherite strategies in ACGB’s drama development between 1984 and 1994’, Contemporary Theatre Review, Volume 17 2 , 2007, pp. 227-29 </ref> During Rix's time his concern for social justice appeared in other ways. When he took office, for example, the Drama Panel was male-dominated, by 1993 there was gender parity on the Panel, something his female successor – paradoxically – unbalanced again in favour of men.",0

"Herndon Davis was commissioned by the Central City Opera Association to paint a series of paintings for the Central City Opera House. He also worked on the Teller House in Central City, Colorado. While staying at the hotel, he painted 'The Face on the Barroom Floor' mural on the floor of the bar, which is believed to depict his wife and may have been inspired by the poem 'The Face upon the Barroom Floor' by Hugh Antoine d'Arcy.

Davis captured realistic images of Denver's landmarks, generally in watercolor, some of which no longer exist. Once considered the ""Delmonico of the West"" the Charpiot's Hotel had become a ""shabby apartment building with seedy storefronts with old cars lined up in front of it."" He captured the ""tattered"" nature of what had once been the ""elegant"" Arcade Saloon, a gambling hall located on Larimer. Other places that Davis captured were the Palace Variety Theatre and Grayson's store and other 16th buildings in Eugene Field Alley. The ''Rocky Mountain News'' published an article, with commentary provided by Joe Emerson Smith, in the 1940s about his paintings of landmarks.

"Typically, an analysis begins by collecting information on certain features of all the organisms in question, and then deciding which versions were present in their common ancestor ''plesiomorphies'' and which have been derived since ''apomorphies'' . Usually this is done by considering some ''outgroup'' of organisms we know are not too closely related to any of the organisms in question. Only apomorphies are of any use in characterising cladistic divisions. Next, different possible cladograms are drawn up and evaluated. Clades are typically drawn so that they can have as many synapomorphies as possible. The idea is that a sufficiently large number of characteristics should be large enough to overwhelm any examples of convergent evolution . In other words, there are many ways in which plants and animals, etc., may evolve features that resemble each other because of environmental conditions. A well-known type of convergent evolution is insect mimicry, in which some insects that are edible come to superficially resemble other insects that are inedible, and so escape being eaten. In practice, neutral features like exact ''ultrastructure'' a term for extremely fine structure, microscopic or molecular composition of cellular structure tend to do just that, to provide evidence for real relationships even when the appearance of organisms makes it otherwise difficult. When equivalent possibilities turn up, one is usually chosen based on the principle of ''parsimony'': the most compact arrangement is likely the best a variation of Occam's razor . Another approach, particularly useful in molecular evolution, is maximum likelihood , which selects the optimal cladogram that has the highest likelihood based on a specific probability model of changes.","Typically, an analysis begins by collecting information on certain features of all the organisms in question, and then deciding which versions were present in their common ancestor ''plesiomorphies'' and which have been derived since ''apomorphies'' .

"== History of the Classical Period == ===Early Classical Style 1730-1760 === At first the new style took over baroque forms - the ternary ""aria da capo"" and the ""sinfonia"" and ""concerto"" - and simply composed with simpler parts and more emphatic sections. However, over time, the new aesthetic caused radical changes in how pieces were put together - the basic layouts changed. See Sonata Form . Composers from this period sought dramatic effects, striking melodies, and clearer textures. One important break with the past was the radical overhaul of opera by Christoph Willibald Gluck , who cut away a great deal of the layering and improvisional ornament, and focused on the points of modulation and transition. By making these moments where the harmony changes more focal, he created the ability for powerful dramatic shifts in the emotional color of the music. He used instrumentation, melody and changes in mode to highlight these moments. Among the most successful composer, Gluck spawned many emulators, for example Antonio Salieri .

However, over time, the new aesthetic caused radical changes in how pieces were put together - the basic layouts changed. See Sonata Form . Composers from this period sought dramatic effects, striking melodies, and clearer textures. One important break with the past was the radical overhaul of opera by Christoph Willibald Gluck , who cut away a great deal of the layering and improvisional ornament, and focused on the points of modulation and transition.

"The Jewish Chautauqua Society is an interfaith education program of the Men of Reform Judaism, a U.S. nonprofit organization. Its mission is to disseminate knowledge of the Jewish religion by studying its history and literature, offering popular courses of instruction, and publishing educational materials.

Founded in 1893 by Henry Berkowitz, the society was modeled after the Chautauqua Institution in New York. The first assembly was held in Atlantic City in 1897, and it has since expanded to three weeks with various study and entertainment departments.

The society's influence led to the creation of the London Jewish Study Society. Its official publications include the Menorah Magazine from New York City and the Assembly Record from Philadelphia.

"The 50 State Quarters Program was created to support a new generation of coin collectors and became the most successful numismatic program in history, with roughly half of the U.S. population collecting the coins. The U.S. federal government made additional profits of $3.0 billion from collectors seigniorage taking the coins out of circulation.

States employed one of two approaches to select designs: 33 states had governors choose the final design based on advisory groups and citizens' recommendations, while 17 states allowed citizens to vote online or through other public means. The U.S. Mint engravers applied all approved design concepts.

The program received significant publicity due to media attention surrounding each state's quarter release.

Arizona: The banner reading 'Grand Canyon State' on the Arizona quarter is intended to split the coin into two sections, representing the Grand Canyon and the saguaro cactus in different areas of the state.

Georgia: The outline of Georgia on the quarter appears to have accidentally left out Dade County, which seceded from the United States in 1860 but rejoined in 1945.

Missouri: Paul Jackson's design for the Missouri quarter was allegedly needlessly redesigned by a Mint engraver. A private mint later demonstrated that Jackson's original submission was coinable.

Tennessee: Some sources claim inaccuracies in the instruments depicted on the Tennessee quarter, such as the number of strings on the guitar and the location of tubing on the trumpet.

"The historiography of Juan Manuel de Rosas is highly controversial. Most Argentine historians take an approach either for or against him, influencing much of Argentina's historiography. The nature of Rosas' government was disputed even by contemporaries during the Argentine Civil Wars. Many Unitarian Party leaders expatriated to neighboring countries during Rosas' rule. Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, living in Chile, wrote 'Facundo,' a biography of Facundo Quiroga that was actually used to attack Rosas. However, most unitarians were located in Montevideo and wrote many reports against Rosas, considering him a ruthless dictator and attributing him many crimes. These writings were meant to promote an European intervention in the conflict. One report, written by José Rivera Indarte, attributed over 22,000 deaths to Rosas' government. This report was published in Europe and Manuel Moreno treated it as libel. The Montevidean reports were echoed in France, where Montevideo had a significant number of French citizens. Alexandre Dumas wrote the novel 'The New Troy' based on the reports of Melchor Pacheco, and Adolphe Thiers urged François Guizot to intervene in the conflict. France started the blockade of the Río de la Plata, and years later the Anglo-French blockade allied with Britain. The international conflict also generated sympathy for Rosas among other South-Americans, who saw him as a fellow American standing against powerful foreign aggressors. He was supported by Francisco Antonio Pinto, José Ballivián, and many newspapers, such as the Brazilians 'O Brado de Amazonas' and 'O Sentinella da Monarchia.' Even some Europeans saw him as a romantic hero. The liberator José de San Martín, who was living in France, had many letters with Rosas, manifesting his full support, both against the Europeans and the Unitarians. San Martín inherited Rosas' sword, in a token of respect.","The historiography of Juan Manuel de Rosas is highly controversial.

"Animal lead poisoning, also known as avian plumbism or avian saturnism for birds, is a veterinary condition caused by increased levels of lead in an animal's body. Lead interferes with various bodily processes and is toxic to many organs and tissues, including the heart, bones, intestines, kidneys, and nervous systems. It is particularly toxic to young animals.

Lead poisoning can be acute or chronic, with acute intoxication potentially leading to death. Exposure routes include contaminated air, water, soil, food, and grit (lead shots, lead bullets). Lead has been known to cause die-offs of wild bird populations.

When hunters use lead shot, waterfowl such as ducks and other species can ingest the spent pellets and be poisoned; predators that eat these birds are also at risk. Lead shot-related waterfowl poisonings were first documented in the US in the 1880s.

Other threats to wildlife include lead paint, sediment from lead mines and smelters, and lead weights from fishing lines. Cows, horses, and pet animals are susceptible to the effects of lead toxicity, with sources of exposure including paint, blinds, toys, and contaminated soil and water.","'''Animal lead poisoning''' also known as '''avian plumbism''', or '''avian saturnism''' for birds is a veterinary condition and pathology caused by increased levels of the Heavy metal chemistry |heavy metal lead in animal's body.

"When there is a backline, musicians are expected to bring their own instruments and equipment, except for keyboardists who play Hammond organ or grand piano. Guitarists typically bring electric guitars, acoustic guitars, and effects units like reverb and distortion pedals. Bassists bring electric basses, upright bass, and effects units such as audio compressors or bass preamplifiers. Drummers still need to bring their own snare drum, drumsticks, and sometimes cymbals. Although musicians must bring instruments and gear, having a backline speeds up setup and soundchecking. For example, the bassist's bass stack is already set up on stage, plugged in, connected to the mixing console via DI box output, and a microphone is set up in front of the speaker to capture the amp's tone. The drummer only needs to put her snare on the stand and place cymbals on stands around the drum kit.","When there is a backline, musicians are expected to bring their own instruments and equipment, except for keyboardists who play Hammond organ or grand piano.

 Buford Early - Known_Space#ARM|ARM general known for unorthodox tactics.







There are a total of four Man-Kzin Wars, as well as major and minor ""Kzinti incidents"". The First War began circa 2367. By this time, Human space was in the middle of the ""Long Peace"". Known_Space#ARM|ARM , the United Nations security force, has completely suppressed all ""dangerous"" technologies, histories, mental illnesses, and media, leading to not only an end of war and almost all violent crimes, but a change in society so vast that most people have a difficulty even conceptualizing such things.
The Kzinti, with vast technical superiority including gravity drives, telepath s, and a large military empire , detected a human colonization ship in deep space, the ''Angel's Pencil''. After the Kzin telepath learned that the humans were unarmed and didn't even understand the concept of weapons, they attempted to kill the human crew in a slow, painful manner using an inductive heating weapon hoping to capture their ship intact for intelligence purposes. However, one of the humans used the ship's powerful drive system which doubled as interstellar communications laser as a weapon and destroyed the Kzin ship, beginning the First Man-Kzin War. The crew then warned Earth of the warlike aliens, although the transmissions were initially dismissed as an outbreak of psychosis. Then a similar encounter between another human ship and Kzin vessel led to the destruction of the more primitive human ship. However, one of the human prisoners, with the aid of a rogue telepath, was able to escape to the ''Angel's Pencil'' and warn them of the danger from their increasing penetration into Kzinti space. 
In the course of the First Man-Kzin War, the Kzinti invaded and occupied the human colony of Wunderland , in the Alpha Centauri system, as a staging point for an attack on Earth. Human ships attempting escape back to Earth were shot down, but a single vessel managed to carry some refugees to the sister colony We Made It. The Kzinti fleet moved on to Earth, but in a replay of first contact, the peaceful humans used laser communication s, fusion drives, and mass driver s to cut the first invasion fleet to ribbons. Over the next several decades, three more fleets were launched against Earth , and all were beaten back. However, after near defeat by the fourth fleet, it was becoming clear to Earth's military leaders that the Kzinti were learning to wage war more effectively than their traditional ""scream and leap"" tactics, and that the Solar system's defenses would quickly succumb to the Kzinti's superior numbers, firepower, and technology, were it only wielded with a modicum of tactical and strategic sense. In order to delay the next attack, a Terran Bussard ramjet starship was utilized to transport and deploy several relativistic kill vehicle s in the Wunderland system. Using iron slugs accelerated to 99% of the speed of light, it devastated a portion of the planet, killing humans and Kzinti alike and delaying the launch of yet another Kzin fleet against Earth. A number of specialists traveled aboard this ship, using Slaver stasis field s for lithobraking , and successfully assassinated the Kzin military leader on Wunderland, Chuut-Riit. Despite this setback for the Kzin cause, preparations for a fifth and decisive assault fleet were nearing completion. 
At this point, a passing Outsider Known Space |Outsider ship sold the colony of We Made It the manual for a hyperdrive , a technology unknown to the Kzinti. Dimity Carmody, an escapee from Wunderland and a genius who had toyed with Faster-than-light|FTL drive concepts since before the occupation, managed to construct a working prototype drive using the manual. Hyperdrive ships were dispatched to Earth, where the faster-than-light drive was installed on several ships for a preemptive attack on the Fifth Invasion fleet. The attack hit the Kzin amidst internal struggles following the death of their leader. Due to the huge success, Wunderland was quickly liberated, freeing the fleet to attack other Kzinti worlds. The FTL Drive|FTL drive allowed the human fleets to coordinate and concentrate their forces beyond anything the Kzinti could manage, even letting them outrun and jam the news of each successive Kzin defeat. The first indication the Kzinti Patriarchy had, that much of the Kzin empire was gone and that a significant percentage of all Kzinti had died was when human warships appeared in the skies above their homeworld.

The crew then warned Earth of the warlike aliens, although the transmissions were initially dismissed as an outbreak of psychosis. Then a similar encounter between another human ship and Kzin vessel led to the destruction of the more primitive human ship. However, one of the human prisoners, with the aid of a rogue telepath, was able to escape to the ''Angel's Pencil'' and warn them of the danger from their increasing penetration into Kzinti space.
In the course of the First Man-Kzin War, the Kzinti invaded and occupied the human colony of Wunderland , in the Alpha Centauri system, as a staging point for an attack on Earth. Human ships attempting escape back to Earth were shot down, but a single vessel managed to carry some refugees to the sister colony We Made It. The Kzinti fleet moved on to Earth, but in a replay of first contact, the peaceful humans used laser communication s, fusion drives, and mass driver s to cut the first invasion fleet to ribbons. Over the next several decades, three more fleets were launched against Earth , and all were beaten back. However, after near defeat by the fourth fleet, it was becoming clear to Earth's military leaders that the Kzinti were learning to wage war more effectively than their traditional ""scream and leap"" tactics, and that the Solar system's defenses would quickly succumb to the Kzinti's superior numbers, firepower, and technology, were it only wielded with a modicum of tactical and strategic sense. In order to delay the next attack, a Terran Bussard ramjet starship was utilized to transport and deploy several relativistic kill vehicle s in the Wunderland system. Using iron slugs accelerated to 99% of the speed of light, it devastated a portion of the planet, killing humans and Kzinti alike and delaying the launch of yet another Kzin fleet against Earth. A number of specialists traveled aboard this ship, using Slaver stasis field s for lithobraking , and successfully assassinated the Kzin military leader on Wunderland, Chuut-Riit. Despite this setback for the Kzin cause, preparations for a fifth and decisive assault fleet were nearing completion.
At this point, a passing Outsider Known Space |Outsider ship sold the colony of We Made It the manual for a hyperdrive , a technology unknown to the Kzinti. Dimity Carmody, an escapee from Wunderland and a genius who had toyed with Faster-than-light|FTL drive concepts since before the occupation, managed to construct a working prototype drive using the manual. Hyperdrive ships were dispatched to Earth, where the faster-than-light drive was installed on several ships for a preemptive attack on the Fifth Invasion fleet. The attack hit the Kzin amidst internal struggles following the death of their leader. Due to the huge success, Wunderland was quickly liberated, freeing the fleet to attack other Kzinti worlds. The FTL Drive|FTL drive allowed the human fleets to coordinate and concentrate their forces beyond anything the Kzinti could manage, even letting them outrun and jam the news of each successive Kzin defeat. The first indication the Kzinti Patriarchy had, that much of the Kzin empire was gone and that a significant percentage of all Kzinti had died was when human warships appeared in the skies above their homeworld.",0

"Crowdsourcing is a specific sourcing model in which organizations use contributions from Internet users to obtain needed services or ideas, improving cost, speed, quality, flexibility, and scalability of work.

It was coined in 2005 as a portmanteau of 'crowd' and 'outsourcing.' This mode of sourcing divides work between participants to achieve a cumulative result, which was successful before the digital age. Crowdsourcing is distinguished from outsourcing in that the work can come from an undefined public instead of being commissioned from a specific group.

Advantages of using crowdsourcing include improved costs, speed, quality, flexibility, scalability, and diversity. It provides a way for organizations to learn beyond their employees' knowledge, as seen in LEGO Ideas. Crowdsourcing can also involve microtasks performed by large, paid crowds, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk.

 absolute falsity, reality mismatch and invention of the necessary ""facts"" - design and creation of a so-called ""parallel reality""
 situationality, controversy itself, to what was reported a short time ago - counting on the full memory loss of audiences
 goal - not to convince, as in the classical propaganda, but to make an information field ""dirty"" so people would trust nobody.

"Propositions are units of meaning.

"Charles Parsons writes that Strawson is perhaps the most eloquent of commentators who have 'read Kant as saying that the mind literally makes the world, along the way imposing spatial and temporal form on it.' Philosopher Roger Scruton identifies 'The Bounds of Sense' as one of the most important recent commentaries on the 'Critique of Pure Reason'. E. J. Lowe writes in 'The Oxford Companion to Philosophy' (1995) that while 'The Bounds of Sense' is widely admired, Strawson is seen by some as being unduly dismissive of Kant's doctrine of transcendental idealism and over-optimistic in his suggestion that many of the central arguments of Kant's critical philosophy can survive the repudiation of that doctrine. Thomas Baldwin writes in 'The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy' (1995) that Strawson's aim is to extricate what he sees as the profound truths concerning the presuppositions of objective experience and judgment that Kant's transcendental arguments establish from the mysterious metaphysics of Kant's transcendental idealism. Critics have argued that this attempt leads to an unstable position, as transcendental arguments can tell us only what we must suppose to be the case, meaning that if Kant's idealism is abandoned, we can draw conclusions concerning the way the world itself must be only if we add the verificationist thesis that ability to make sense of such suppositions requires ability to verify them.","The Bounds of Sense has been praised by philosophers Charles Parsons and Roger Scruton, who write that Strawson is perhaps the most eloquent commentator on Kant's Critique of Pure Reason.

'''Harald Ingemann Nielsen''' 26 October 1941 – 11 August 2015 was a Denmark|Danish Association football|footballer . He played professionally for Italy|Italian club Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna F.C. where he was the league top scorer '' capocannoniere '' in Bologna's 1964 Serie A championship winning season. Harald Nielsen played 14 games for the Denmark national football team in 1959 and 1960, scoring 15 goals, and he was known as ''Guld-Harald'' Gold-Harald . He was a football entrepreneur having continuously worked for the professionalization of both the Danish national team and the national league.<ref> Cite book|last1=Nielsen |first1=Harald |author2=Lindskog, John |title=Kaerlighed A/S |year=2002 |publisher=People's Press |location= Copenhagen |language=Danish |isbn=9788770550727 </ref>
In the top Danish league, Nielsen debuted for Frederikshavn against Boldklubben Frem in March 1960. Frederikshavn won 3-1, with Harald Nielsen scoring all three goals. The team finished the league in fifth place with Nielsen becoming league top scorer.
In 1961, Harald Nielsen moved abroad to play professionally for Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna F.C. in Italy. At Bologna, ''il freddo danese'' the cold Dane was a part of the 1963-64 Serie A winning squad, and he was the Capocannoniere|Italian league topscorer in both 1963 and 1964. Following six seasons at Bologna, Harald Nielsen moved to Internazionale F.C. in 1967, in a Transfer football |transfer deal which made him the World football transfer record|most expensive player in the world at the time. Although he started by winning the unofficial world cup for teams by beating Santos FC|Santos with Pele 1-0 in New York, Nielsen did not find the same degree of success with Inter as in Bologna, and following years at S.S.C. Napoli and U.C. Sampdoria a back injury kept him mostly off the field, he ended his career in 1970.

Harald Nielsen made his debut for the Danish national team on 13 September 1959 against Norway national football team|Norway in Oslo , as the youngest Danish national team player ever. Only 17 years and 322 days old, he scored a single goal in the 4-2 win.
In the summer of 1960, he represented Denmark at the 1960 Summer Olympics football tournament in Rome . Denmark finished runners-up and Nielsen was the leading goals scorer of the tournament.
His international potential as a striker became obvious already on 10 May 1960, when he scored two goals in a Stævnet|Copenhagen XI game against the 1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 Brazilian world champions team , which two years earlier had another largely unknown 17-year-old Pelé making his debut on the world stage. The two would meet again playing for their respective club teams later in their careers, but in a strange twist of fates while Pelé was essentially banned from playing outside of Brazilian team s , Nielsen would be banned from playing on the Danish national team. As the Danish Football Association did not allow professionals to represent the Danish national team until 1971, Nielsen was banned from the national team at 19 years old when he joined Bologna, and would not play another national team match. This was a great frustration to Harald Nielsen, which he repeatedly voiced in interviews with Danish media.<ref> Cite book |last1=Nielsen |first1=Harald |author2=Jakobsen, Joakim |title=Guld-Harald - Topscorer, Idol, Rebel |year=2009 |publisher=Gyldendal|location= Copenhagen |language=Danish |isbn=9788702079357 </ref>
Harald Nielsen was a prolific entrepreneur who started numerous companies. Just after ending his career he started a firm together with his wife, former actress Rudi Hansen|Rudi Nielsen , which imports Italian leather works to Scandinavia . He became involved in professionalising football in Denmark in the 1970s, and in 1977 he and later Minister of Science, Technology and Development Denmark |Danish Minister of Science Helge Sander planned to found a professional Danish football league. As a consequence of these plans, Danish Football Association finally allowed professional football in Denmark from 1978. Harald Nielsen along with Alex Friedman founded - and became the first chairman of FC København A/S later Parken Sport & Entertainment whose primary activity was the Danish club FC København from 1992–1997, he stepped down from the board in 2007 and became the clubs first honorary member. He was Protektor for the Legends Club and until his death watched all the home matches of FC København from Parken's A-stand. He was chairman and co-owner/founder of the largest summer house building company in Denmark. He was president of the Rebild National Park Society from 1997-2007. He led the Gunnar Nu Foundation for 18 years until 2009 and presided the distribution of over DKK 9 million to Danish sports in those years. From 2003 until his death, he was chairman/co-owner of ABSI A/S., one of the leading trade and loyalty solutions companies in Scandinavia.

"Appearance and Reality comprises two volumes: Appearance and Reality. Bradley argues in the first that most things, including objects and their qualities, time and space, causation, the self, and things-in-themselves are appearances. In the second, he attempts to describe the reality these appearances misrepresent as the Absolute, a single cosmic experience of which people are components. Ordinary concepts provide a pragmatically useful way of thinking about the world but being incoherent they cannot grasp reality satisfactorily. Reality is a matter of degree: concepts are true or false of reality in different degrees. The concept of the Absolute is an attempt to understand something that cannot be fully comprehended. Bradley tries to establish these conclusions by arguing that reality must have a unitary togetherness and all concrete reality must be psychical in nature.","Appearance and Reality comprises two volumes: Appearance and Reality.

"Early Scouts tied a knot in their neckerchief scarf to fasten it around the neck. In the United States, experiments were made with rings made from bone, rope or wood.

Hostas are herbaceous perennial plant s, growing from rhizome s or stolon s,<ref> with broad lanceolate or ovate leaf|leaves varying widely in size by species from 1–18 in 3–45&nbsp;cm long and 0.75–12 in 2–30&nbsp;cm broad. The smallest varieties are called miniatures. Variation among the numerous cultivars is even greater, with clumps ranging from less than four in 10&nbsp;cm across and three in 8&nbsp;cm high to more than six ft 200&nbsp;cm across and four ft 130&nbsp;cm high. Leaf color in wild species is typically green, although some species e.g., '' Hosta sieboldiana|H. sieboldiana '' are known for a glaucous waxy leaf coating that gives a blue appearance to the leaf. Some species have a glaucous white coating covering the underside of the leaves. Natural mutations of native species are known with yellow-green ""gold"" colored leaves or with leaf variegation either white/cream or yellowish edges or centers . Variegated plants very often give rise to Sport botany |sports that are the result of the reshuffling of cell layers during bud formation, producing foliage with mixed pigment sections. In seedlings variegation is generally maternally derived by chloroplast transfer and is not a genetically inheritable trait.

"'''Bicapitalization''' or '''camel case''' frequently written '''CamelCase''' is the practice of writing compound noun and adjective|compound word s or phrases where the terms are joined without whitespace|space s, and every term is capitalization|capitalized . The name comes from a supposed resemblance between the bumpy outline of the compound word and the humps of a camel . CamelCase synonyms include: '''CapWords''' in Python programming language|Python  . '''PascalCase''' used by Microsoft CamelCase apparently originated as an identifier naming convention for programming language s, in the 1970s or 1980s , but eventually spread outside that community and is now often used in marketing for naming corporations and products. One early commercial example of CamelCase is the 1950s CinemaScope film projection system. ==Origins== ===Programmers' choice=== It has been claimed that CamelCase originated within the culture of C programming language|C programmers and hacker s. In programs of any significant size there is a need for descriptive hence multi-word identifier s, like ""<tt>previous balance</tt>"" or ""<tt>end of file</tt>"". Allowing spaces within identifiers would cause problems for compilers, and just writing the words together as in ""<tt>endoffile</tt>"" would make the programs unreadable. One early language, Fortran|FORTRAN , did allow spaces to be embedded into identifiers, and that did result in allowing a few ambiguous syntactical expressions. COBOL , the first major programming language to support compound names, used hyphen ""<tt>-</tt>"" between terms, e.g. ""<tt>END-OF-FILE</tt>. It should be noted that the common punched card character sets of the time had no lower-case letters and no other special character that could be used for the purpose. The later ""algebraic"" languages such as C , which needed the hyphen for the minus operator, adopted the underscore character ""<tt>_</tt>"" which was mandated by the new ASCII standard as word joiner. Underscore-separated compounds like ""<tt>end_of_file</tt>"" are still prevalent in C programs and libraries. However, in most keyboards the underscore key is inconveniently placed, and must be typed with the help of the <tt>SHIFT</tt> key; moreover, in many fonts the underscore character is easily confused with a blank space or with a minus sign. And in the 1970s , small display size and compiler limits on identifier length worked together to encourage brevity. So &mdash; according to this theory &mdash; many programmers choose to use CamelCase instead, because it yielded legible compound names with fewer keystrokes in less space. ===The Alto keyboard=== Another theory is that CamelCase actually started at Xerox PARC around 1978, with the Mesa programming language developed for the Xerox Alto computer. This machine lacked an underscore key, so the Mesa libraries and the Alto operating system had to be coded all in CamelCase. The Smalltalk programming language , which was also developed originally on the Alto and became quite popular in the early 1980s , may have been instrumental in spreading the style outside PARC. Another boost was provided by Niklaus Wirth &mdash; the inventor of Pascal programming language|Pascal &mdash; who acquired the taste for CamelCase during a sabbatical at PARC, and used it in Modula programming language|Modula , his next programming language. ==The spread of CamelCase== Be that as it may, CamelCase eventually spread via hacker culture into mainstream use and became fashion able for corporate trade name s during the popularization of the personal computer in the 1980s and 1990s . Here are some examples: usenet|UseNet VisiCalc WorldCom CamelCase is now the official convention for file names and identifiers in the Java programming language , and the file name convention on Amiga computers. ==Variations on CamelCase== In '''upper CamelCase''' style, the first letter of every word is written in upper case, as in ""TheColourOfTheBar"". In '''lower CamelCase''' the first word is left uncapitalized, as in ""theColourOfTheBar"". Coding standard s based on CamelCase like the pioneering Mesa programming language|Mesa style, or the modern Java programming language|Java style typically specify which of these variants should be used for specific kinds of entities &mdash; variable computer science |variable s, field computer science |record fields , method computer science |method s, procedure computer science |procedures , type computer science |types , etc.. The Microsoft .NET Guidelines define '''CamelCase''' as lower CamelCase, and refer to upper CamelCase as '''Pascal case'''. ==See also== CamelCase and Wiki CamelCase and Wikipedia ==External link==  .NET Framework General Reference Capitalization Styles de:CamelCase","'''Bicapitalization''' or '''camel case''' frequently written '''CamelCase''' is the practice of writing compound noun and adjective|compound word s or phrases where the terms are joined without whitespace|space s, and every term is capitalization|capitalized .companies. The name comes from a supposed resemblance between the bumpy outline of the compound word and the humps of a camel . CamelCase is a standard identifier naming convention for several programming language s, and has became fashionable in marketing for names of products and companies. CamelCase synonyms include: '''CapWords''' in Python programming language|Python  . '''PascalCase''' used by Microsoft ==Origins of CamelCase== CamelCase has been sporadically used in marketing for naming corporations and products, at least since the introduction of the CinemaScope cinema|movie projection system in the 1950s . However its use became widespread only in the 1970s or 1980s , when it was adopted as a standard or alternative identifier naming convention|naming convention for multi-word identifier s in several programming language s. There are two theories as to why and where that custom started. ===Multiword identifiers=== In programs of any significant size there is a need for descriptive hence multi-word identifier s, like ""<tt>previous balance</tt>"" or ""<tt>end of file</tt>"". Writing the words together as in ""<tt>endoffile</tt>"" is not satisfactory since the names often became unreadable. Therefore the pioneer prgramming language COBOL allowed hyphen ""<tt>-</tt>"" to be used between words of compount identifiers, as in ""<tt>END-OF-FILE</tt>. The contemporary ""algebraic"" language Fortran|FORTRAN preempted the hyphen for the minus operator, but allowed spaces to be arbitrarily embedded into identifiers; so that <tt>TOTAMP</tt> could be written <tt>TOT AMP</tt> &mdash; or <tt>TO TAMP</tt>. However this feature was largely useless because most FORTRAN compilers did not allow identifiers longer than six letters. It should be noted that the common punched card character sets of the time had no lower-case letters and no other special character that could be used for the purpose. But by the late 1960 s, the ASCII character set standard was already established, and so the designers of the C language adopted the underscore character ""<tt>_</tt>"" as word joiner. Underscore-separated compounds like ""<tt>end_of_file</tt>"" are still prevalent in C programs and libraries. ===The ""Lazy Programmer"" theory=== One theory on the origins of CamelCase in computing claims that the style originated within the culture of C programming language|C programmers and hacker s, who found it more convenient than the standard underscore-based style. Indeed, in most keyboards the underscore key is inconveniently placed, and must be typed with the help of the <tt>SHIFT</tt> key. Also, in many fonts the underscore character is easily confused with a blank space or with a minus sign. Moreover, compiler limits on identifier length and the small computer display s available the 1970s worked together to encourage brevity.

His efforts were rewarded on February 22, 1807, when the motion to abolish the Atlantic slave trade was carried in the House of Commons with an overwhelming majority.
