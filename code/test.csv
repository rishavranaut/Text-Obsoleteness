"Thanatosensitivity is an approach to research and design that integrates mortality, dying, and death into user-centred design. It was first coined by Michael Massimi and Andrea Charise in 2009 as a humanistically-grounded approach to human-computer interaction (HCI) research and design. The term thanatosensitive comes from the ancient Greek personification of death, Thanatos. This inter-disciplinarity is crucial because studies of death and mortality are rarely amenable to laboratory study or traditional fieldwork approaches. Thanatosensitivity offers a non-invasive strategy for understanding conceptual and practical issues surrounding death, computing, and human experience.","Thanatosensitivity is an epistemological approach that integrates mortality, dying, and death into traditional user-centered design methods.

After the Soviets returned to Lithuania in 1944, Poška was appointed as the head of the Library Department of Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Lithuania’s Education Commissariat. For refusing the orders to destroy the books published before the Soviet occupation, Poška was in 1945 arrested and sentenced to imprisonment in a forced labor camp in Siberia. He was first sent to prison in Archangelsk and later to a forced labor camp in Komiya. In 1948, his forced-labor sentence was replaced with a forced relocation to Central Asia without the right to ever return to Lithuania. His academic nature won him positions at several ethnographic museums of Central Asia in 1949-1959, but due to his status of a political prisoner he could not assume leading posts and publish his works. He worked in a museum of Petropavlovsk in Kazakhstan 1949-1953 , in the Museum of Osh in Kyrgyzstan 1953-1957 , in Andizhan Museum in Uzbekistan and briefly in the State Museum of Dushanbe Tajikistan in 1958-1959.

After his return home Poška worked as a lecturer, a correspondent of several newspapers, and the chairman of the Lithuanian Esperantist Club in 1960-1969. Despite being fully rehabilitated, he was not allowed to continue academic activities and publish his books until the Perestroika period in 1985. He headed several research expeditions to Central Asia, travelled to the Caucasus Mountains, attended the events of Soviet Esperanto movement. The last decade of his life Poška spent under the piles of his rescued archive, trying and failing to publish it. Most of his writings were published by his supporters already after his death, including his famous eight-volume book on his journey to India, “From the Baltic Sea to the Bay of Bengal.”<ref name="":3"" />

"Vittal Mallya, the youngest of three children to an army doctor Lt. Col. Dr. Bantwal Ganapathi Mallya, attended The Doon School and Presidency College in Kolkata. He traveled abroad for two years to gain practical knowledge. In 1947, at age 22, he was elected as United Breweries' first Indian director. After a year, he replaced R.G.N.Price as chairman of the company. Mallya operated from Calcutta initially and married later after becoming chairman of United Breweries Limited. He moved to Bangalore with his wife Lalitha Ramaiah and son Vijay in 1958. Despite health issues following a heart attack at age 59, he built the UB Empire and diversified into various businesses.","==Early Life & Education<ref name="":0""> Cite web|url= Information - Media - UB Group|website=theubgroup.com|access-date=2016-03-17 </ref>==
The youngest of three children, Vittal Mallya was born in Dhaka, now in Bangladesh, on February 8, 1924. He was born in an army family to Mrs. Devi Mallya and Lt. Col. Bantwal Ganapathi Mallya a Medical Doctor with an FRCS degree . Vittal received several double promotions during his academic career for outstanding performance. Vittal Mallya capped an academic career with two of India's most prestigious educational institutions, The Doon School and Presidency College, Kolkata , and traveled abroad for over two years learning Spanish in the process to gain first-hand practical knowledge that he believed to be a lot more valuable than formal education.

in 1946-47 and started acquiring the shares of United Breweries Limited. In 1947, Mallya was elected as United Breweries' first Indian director. After a year, he replaced R.G.N.Price as the chairman of the company. In 1951, he acquired McDowell's No.1 Celebration|McDowell & Company Limited.

Moving to Bangalore in 1952, Mallya started a steady acquisition of small breweries and distilleries. New breweries were established in Kerala Cherthala, 1959 , Andhra Pradesh Hyderabad, 1969 , Goa Ponda, 1971 and Bihar Hatidah, 1973 . 

By the early '60s, Mallya, back in Calcutta , gained further control of the liquor market by acquiring Carew & Company Limited and Phipson & Company Limited the latter a major liquor distribution company , followed in the early '70s by another distribution firm, Herbertsons Limited.

It also began its association, about this time, with Hoechst AG of Germany while co-promoting Hoechst Pharmaceuticals Limited, now known as Aventis Pharma India.

The simultaneous move into food products started with the acquisition of Kissan Products in 1962. When Herbert sons was pocketed a decade later, Mallya also bagged its Dipy's division, giving him a virtual stranglehold on a series of processed food products.

In 1977, when an official prohibition drive sent the breweries and distilleries into a tailspin, Mallya showed his foresight by buying up or gaining control through management contracts of yet more breweries Premier, Jupiter, Punjab and Indo-Lowenbrau and distilleries in Udaipur, Alwar, Mirganj, Serampore and also set up a plant in Pondicherry, as others sold out in the face of a market slump. In the process, he finally pipped Mohan Meakin to the title of beer and liquor king. 

Mallya got the Kashmir Government to give him two acres on lease to start a nursery, and then distributed hops seedlings to Kashmir farmers and buys up all their produce - giving him effective control of the beer industry's most vital ingredient.

He also became chairman of British Paints with the help of Hoechst AG, which had earlier acquired British Paints' parent company abroad, the Berger group. Then through Cadbury Schweppes, international associates of Kissan Products, he moved on to the board of Cadbury India, to become its chairman a few years later. And taking advantage of disinvestments by multinationals, he became chairman of the Indian Sewing Machine Company and Malayalam Plantations the large tea and rubber company , and also a director of Bush Boake Allen. 

Two other important acquisitions include Hindustan Polymers taken from the Shriram group and Mysore Electro-Chemical Works makers of MEC batteries .

In 1981, Mallya controlled 10 breweries and 14 distilleries, seven processed food companies, six investment companies, two small packaging units, three drug firms, soft drinks bottling plants, a battery unit and one of the company's two styrene companies, while heading a handful of other companies even though he did not have controlling interest.

== Controversies<ref name="":1"" /> ==
Business rivals charged him with reveling in the unethical practices of the liquor industry, and maximising profits by making whisky from molasses instead of malt - the former process allegedly costs 5 per cent of the latter, but the resultant whisky is far more harmful to health.

Mallya's name was also linked in 1980 to the then Maharashtra chief minister A.R. Antulay's controversial decisions on alcohol supply.

"Dislocation geometry refers to the study of dislocations in crystal lattices.

Types of Dislocations:

* Edge dislocations: occur when an extra half-plane of atoms is inserted into the lattice, causing a displacement along the edge of the lattice.

* Screw dislocations: occur when a full plane of atoms is rotated around its axis, creating a helical shape in the lattice.

* Mixed dislocations: combine characteristics of both edge and screw dislocations.

* Partial dislocations: smaller versions of dislocations that can move more easily through the lattice.

Dislocations can decompose into partial dislocations to facilitate movement through the crystal lattice.

Observation of Dislocations:

Dislocations can be observed using various techniques, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).

Sources of Dislocations:

Dislocations can arise from various sources, including defects in the crystal structure, impurities, and external stress.

Dislocations, Slip, and Plasticity:

Dislocations play a crucial role in plastic deformation, allowing materials to undergo significant changes in shape without breaking. They can slip in planes containing both the dislocation line and the Burgers Vector.

For screw dislocations, the dislocation line and the Burgers vector are parallel, so the dislocation may slip in any plane containing the dislocation. For edge dislocations, the dislocation and the Burgers vector are perpendicular, so there is only one plane in which the dislocation can slip.

Dislocation Climb:

Dislocation climb allows an edge dislocation to move out of its slip plane, enabling it to move perpendicular to its slip plane. This mechanism is fundamentally different from slip and is essential for understanding plastic deformation.","Dislocations can decompose into partial dislocations to facilitate movement through a crystal lattice.

Dislocations can slip in planes containing both the dislocation line and the Burgers vector.

For an edge dislocation, the dislocation and the Burgers vector are perpendicular, so there is only one plane in which the dislocation can slip.

Dislocation climb allows an edge dislocation to move out of its slip plane, moving it perpendicular to its slip plane. A creep mechanism involving only dislocation climb, known as Harper-Dorn creep, can occur under certain conditions.",1

"Chantal Delsol, born April 16, 1947, in Paris, is a French philosopher, political historian, and novelist. She is openly Catholic and a disciple of Julien Freund and Pierre Boutang. Delsol describes herself as a 'liberal-conservative.'

Delsol was born to a right-wing Catholic family. Her father, Michel Delsol, was a biologist who encouraged her curiosity and love for verification.

She is the founder of the Hannah Arendt Research Institute (1993) and currently teaches at the University of Marne-la-Vallée, where she directs the Centre for European Studies, also known as the Hannah Arendt Institute.

Delsol advocates for federalism, which she believes draws its roots from Catholicism and Germanic baroque culture. She sees it as an innovative system that fosters hope. In contrast to Jean Bodin's Nation-State concept, which she believes stifles geopolitical actions, a federation is an indeterminate contract with flexibility.

Delsol criticizes the current European Union for lacking political unity, describing it as technocratic due to its administrative unity. She argues that Europe lacks a common policy in defense and foreign affairs.

Subsidiarity is a key principle of organization for Delsol, allowing for the separation of powers among authorities. An authority responsible for a group must guarantee its existence while only helping overcome weaknesses.

In her book 'La nature du populisme ou les figures de l'idiot!', Delsol examines contemporary populism and its resurgence in interest. She sees it as a threat to democracy, revealing the flaws of Western democracies due to their universalist ideas.","Chantal Delsol, born on April 16, 1947, in Paris, is a French philosopher, political historian, and novelist.

Delsol is a fervent partisan of federalism, an ideal that draws its roots from Catholicism and Germanic baroque culture. She believes it to be an innovative system, bearing hope. Therefore, she is against the Nation-State concept by Jean Bodin, which she believes stalls geopolitical actions.

She considers the current European Union not a true federation due to its lack of political unity. The EU lacks a common policy in terms of defense and foreign affairs.

For Delsol, subsidiarity is a principal of organization of society: allowing for the separation of powers to different authorities.

In her book 'La nature du populisme ou les figures de l’idiot !', Chantal Delsol examines the stakes of contemporary populism. She believes populism appears to be the greatest danger to democracy, but it also reveals the flaws of Western democracies due to their ideas of universalism.",0

"A '''minicomic''' is a creator-published comic book , often photocopying|photocopied and stapled or with a handmade binding. In the United Kingdom and Europe the term "" British small press comics|small press comic "" is equivalent with minicomic, reserved for those publications measuring A6 105&nbsp;mm × 148&nbsp;mm or less.
Minicomics are a common inexpensive way for those who want to make their own comics on a very small budget, with mostly informal means of distribution business |distribution . A number of cartoonist s who|date=October 2016 have started this way and gone on to more traditional types of publishing, while other more established artists who|date=October 2016 continue to produce minicomics on the side. The minicomic phenomenon is comparable to indie music , in the celebration of the DIY aesthetic and the autonomy of the artist. cn|date=October 2016 
==History==
The term was originally used in the United States and has a somewhat confusing history. Originally, the term ""minicomic"" referred only to size: a '' Digest size#Comics digests|digest comic '' measured 5.5&nbsp;inches wide by 8.5&nbsp;inches tall, while a ''minicomic'' was 5.5&nbsp;inches by 4.25&nbsp;inches. cn|date=October 2016 In reality, there is no standard format for a minicomic. Anything between regular comic book size to even the size of a postage stamp can be considered a minicomic. 
Many minicomics are non-standard sizes for aesthetic reasons, cn|date=October 2016 or are often connected to graphic design and book print ""tricks"" to look good. Many of these typical sizes are convenient for artists using standard office supplies: a Paper size|US letter page can be folded in half to make a digest, or in quarters for a minicomic. These comics are generally photocopied, although some are produced in larger quantities using offset printing . 
An early and unusually popular example of this type of minicomic format is Matt Feazell 's ''Cynicalman'', which began in 1980, or Alfred Huete's award-winning ''DADA'' mini. 
 The earliest and most popular comics in mini- and digest sizes&mdash;predating not only the term ''minicomic'', but even the standard comic-book format&mdash;were the anonymous and pornographic Tijuana bible s of the 1920s. 
Many mini comics in the 1980s were produced by artists influenced by the underground comix scene who were unable to get work published in underground and Alternative comics|alternative publications.<ref> cite book |last1=Dowers |first1=Michael |title=Newave! The Underground Mini Comix Of The 1980s |year=2010 |publisher=Fantagraphics Books |isbn=978-1-60699-313-2 |pages=9–11 |chapter=Introduction </ref>
Currently, the term is used in a more general sense which emphasizes the handmade, informal aspect rather than the format. By this loose definition, a single photocopied page folded in quarters would still be a minicomic, but so would a thicker digest-sized comic, or even a large, elaborate, and relatively expensive photocopied booklet with a screen-printing|silkscreened cover. Even some professionally printed and bound booklets are referred to as minicomics, as long as they are published by the artist and marketed in minicomic venues, but this usage is controversial.
In North America, the United Kingdom and Malaysia, minicomics are currently rare in traditional "" direct market "" comic-book stores; they are often sold directly by the artist at book fairs or through the mail, ordered from website s, or handled by small bookstores and distributors that carry zine s. In terms of production and distribution issues and their audience, minicomics&mdash;of all of the sizes and types mentioned above&mdash;have much more in common with each other, and with zines, than with any traditionally published comics; this may be the reason why the meaning of the term has shifted. In Europe many specialized comic books stores have a special little corner dedicated to the odd off size little self-printed books. On comic book conventions, such as the one in Angoulême , there are large markets where the little books are available. Because most of the books are rather cheap and rare, it has become a collecting target.
Minicomics typically have no editorial oversight, and both their content and quality varies over a huge range. Many of the creators of minicomics do not expect to make a significant amount of money, or even cover their costs, with the price they charge for their comics. These creators may see minicomics as a way to hone their skills or as a way to get their work seen by a larger audience, or may be drawn to the format for aesthetic reasons. Some observers have anticipated that the rise of webcomic s would be the end of minicomics, but as of 2005 this does not appear to be the case.
==Alternate meaning==
The term '''minicomic''' also refers to the small comics that come in the packages of some toys.
===Masters of the Universe===
The first Masters of the Universe MOTU toys did not have a TV series, and thus came with little story booklets and later, comics that showed the original background of the series He-Man as a barbarian, Skeletor from another dimension, etc. . However, after the later sources DC Comics and the TV series started to change that background He-Man as Prince Adam , for example the comics began to reflect those changes.
===Super Powers===
Kenner created a collection of action figures based on the DC Comics super-heroes and super-villains, called Super Powers Collection|Super Powers . The first two waves of the collection came with minicomics which featured the character with which it came, one of the villains from the collection who, obviously, was the antagonist of the story inside the comic and other heroes featured in the collection.
===Transformers===

MRCPs tend to resemble a ""set of plans"" used by the cortex for the generation and control of movement. The BP is activated by voluntary movements involving the SMA and the somatosensory cortex in movement preparation and initiation. Initially only the late BP was considered to be specific for the site of movement and the early BP was thought to be characterized by more general preparation for upcoming movements. However, over the past couple of decades the early BP is considered to perhaps also be site specific within the supplementary motor area SMA and the lateral premotor cortex.<ref name=""WhatisBP""/> Using principal component analysis and functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI the main source of early BP was determined to be Area 6 of the precentral gyrus bilaterally, and the main sources of late BP were determined to be Area 4 also known as the Primary Motor Cortex and Area 6. The current consensus is that the early BP starts first in the SMA, including pre-SMA and SMA proper, and then approximately 400ms later in the lateral premotor cortices bilaterally prior to the movement onset, and the late BP starts in the M1 and premotor cortex contralaterally.<ref name=""WhatisBP""/> 
Some of the first relevant experimentation and subsequent findings about the organization of the primary motor cortex were observed by Wilder Penfield . Penfield, a neurosurgeon in Montreal began his experimentation in the 1950s, to better serve his epileptic patients. Penfield understood that his epileptic patients experience a warning sign before the seizures occur. This knowledge started the beginning of his stimulation experimentations. Here, Penfield tried to induce this warning sign in an attempt to specifically pinpoint the source of epilepsy . Penfield confirmed the presence of a Cortical homunculus|spatial map of the contralateral body of the brain. He noted the location of muscle contractions with the site of electro-stimulation on the surface of the motor cortex and subsequently mapped the motor representation of the pre-central gyrus.

Experimentation via intra-cortical micro-stimulation brought about a more detailed understanding of motor maps.

It can be plagued with nutrient deficiencies, insect and mammal pests, and fungal and bacterial diseases. The L. sativa hybrid biology crosses easily within the species and with some other species within the Lactuca genus; this trait has been used by biologists to broaden the gene pool of cultivated lettuce varieties. In 2013, world production of lettuce combined with chicory was 24.9 million tonnes, with China producing 13.5 million tonnes. Lettuce is the only member of the Lactuca genus grown commercially. Although China is the top producer of lettuce, most of the crop is consumed domestically. Spain is the largest exporter of lettuce, followed by the US.",1
"In physics, the twin paradox is a thought experiment in special relativity involving identical twins. One twin makes a journey into space in a high-speed rocket and returns home to find that the other twin has aged more. This result appears puzzling because each twin sees the other as moving, but it can be resolved within the standard framework of special relativity. The travelling twin's trajectory involves two different inertial frames, one for the outbound journey and one for the inbound journey, so there is no symmetry between their spacetime paths.","In physics, the twin paradox is a thought experiment in special relativity involving identical twins.

"The term 'collegiate institute' originally referred to a distinct type of secondary school in several provinces in Canada. It has since become a synonym for an institution providing secondary education, particularly prominent in Ontario. However, it was also used in Western Canada, with Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan adopting Ontario's parallel school system in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. After the parallel system ended, most institutions were closed or renamed, but some continue to use the term, such as Lethbridge Collegiate Institute in Alberta; Mennonite Brethren Collegiate Institute in Manitoba; and Prince Albert Collegiate Institute in Saskatchewan. In Saskatoon and Regina, the term survives as 'Collegiate', found in public secondary schools' names. In contrast, most of Saskatchewan uses 'High School'.

"==Features== The architecture of the Angkor period used certain specific structural features and styles which along with inscriptions are one of the main methods used to date the temples. ===Corbelling=== Rather than a true arch , the Khmers used corbel arches. These were constructed by adding layers of stones to the walls on either side, with each layer projecting further towards the centre. This method, while adequate, made the temples particularly prone to collapse once the buildings were no longer maintained. ===Colonettes=== Colonette s were used as decoration on either side of doorways. ===Blind doors and windows=== Blind door s were typically used to balance true doorways. Shrines frequently opened only towards one direction: the other three sides therefore featured blind doors to maintain symmetry. Blind window s were often used along otherwise blank walls. ===Gopura=== A gopura was an entrance building. Each enclosure of a temple usually had a gopura at each of the four cardinal point s. In plan they were most often cross-shaped, elongated along the axis of the enclosure wall; where the wall had a gallery, this could be connected to the arms of the gopura. Many gopuras had a tower at the centre of the cross. The lintels and pediments were often decorated, and guardian figures dvarapalas were often placed or carved on either side of the doorways. ===Gallery=== The gallery was a passageway running along the wall of an enclosure or along the axis of a temple, often open to one or both sides. The form evolved during the 10th century from the increasingly long hallways which had earlier been used to surround the central sanctuary. During the later Angkor Wat period, additional half galleries on one side were introduced to buttress the structure of the temple. ===Library=== The library is one of the most common features of Khmer temple architecture, but it is still not certain what they were used for. Most likely they were shrines rather than actual libraries. Free-standing buildings, they were normally placed in pairs on either side of the entrance to an enclosure, opening to the west. ===Hall of Dancers=== The Hall of Dancers is a structure found at Ta Prohm , Preah Khan , Banteay Kdei and Banteay Chhmar . In each case it is a rectangular building elongated along the temple's east axis; and divided into four courtyards by galleries. The roofs were made of perishable materials and have disappeared. The pillars of the galleries are decorated with dancing apsaras, hence the presumption that the buildings were used for dancing. ===Srahs and barays===","==Features== Image:Blinddoortaprohm.JPG|thumb|100px|Blind door at Ta Prohm .

First aircraft were used as long-range artillery to destroy enemy strongholds, attack troop concentrations, and spread panic . Then combined arms forces of tank s and motorised infantry coordinated by two-way radio destroyed tactical targets before moving on, deep into enemy territory.

"spoiler In the current Marvel Universe history, Steve Rogers was a sickly United States|American fine arts student specializing in illustration in the early 1940s before America's entry into World War II . He was disturbed by the rise of the Third Reich enough to attempt to enlist only to be rejected due to his poor constitution. By chance, an United States Army|Army officer looking for test subjects for a top secret defense research project offered Rogers an alternate way to serve his country. The officer was looking for suitable test subjects for a top secret defense research project, Operation: Rebirth. This project consisted of developing a means to create physically superior soldiers and Rogers was deemed ideal. Rogers agreed to volunteer for the research and after a rigorous physical and combat training and selection process, was chosen as the first human test subject. He received injections and oral ingestions of a chemical formula that was termed the Super Soldier Serum, which had been developed by the scientist Dr Emil Erskine who was code-named Dr Reinstein . Rogers was then exposed to a controlled burst of ""Vita-Rays"" that activated the chemicals in his system. Although the process was arduous physically, it successfully altered his physiognomy from his relative frail form to the maximum of human efficiency, including greatly enhanced musculature and reflexes. Unfortunately at this moment of triumph, a Nazi secret agent|spy revealed himself and shot Erskine. Because the scientist had committed the crucial portions of the Super Solder formula to memory, it could not be duplicated. Rogers killed the spy in retaliation and vowed to oppose the enemies of America. Meanwhile, the US government decided to make the most of their one super soldier and eventually made him a superhero who served both as a counter-intelligence agent and a propaganda symbol to counter Nazi Germany's head of terrorist operations, the Red Skull . To that end, Rogers was given a costume modelled after the American Flag, a bulletproof steel shield, a personal sidearm and the name of Captain America. He was also given a cover identity as a clumsy infantry private at Fort Lehigh where he made friends with a teenage mascot , Bucky comics |James Buchanan ""Bucky"" Barnes . Soon, Barnes learned Roger's secret identity|dual identity and offered to keep the secret if he could become his sidekick . Cap agreed, and trained Barnes appropriately. Rogers also received a new shield made from a chance mixture of adamantium , vibranium and an unknown catalyst which formed an indestructible metal light enough to use as a discus -like weapon that could be angled to return to him. It proved so effective that the sidearm was dropped.

He was disturbed by the rise of the Third Reich enough to attempt to enlist only to be rejected due to his poor constitution. By chance, an United States Army|Army officer looking for test subjects for a top secret defense research project offered Rogers an alternate way to serve his country. The officer was looking for suitable test subjects for a top secret defense research project, Operation: Rebirth. This project consisted of developing a means to create physically superior soldiers and Rogers was deemed ideal. Rogers agreed to volunteer for the research and after a rigorous physical and combat training and selection process, was chosen as the first human test subject. He received injections and oral ingestions of a chemical formula that was termed the Super Soldier Serum, which had been developed by the scientist Dr Emil Erskine who was code-named Dr Reinstein . Rogers was then exposed to a controlled burst of ""Vita-Rays"" that activated the chemicals in his system. Although the process was arduous physically, it successfully altered his physiognomy from his relative frail form to the maximum of human efficiency, including greatly enhanced musculature and reflexes. Unfortunately at this moment of triumph, a Nazi secret agent|spy revealed himself and shot Erskine. Because the scientist had committed the crucial portions of the Super Solder formula to memory, it could not be duplicated. Rogers killed the spy in retaliation and vowed to oppose the enemies of America. Meanwhile, the US government decided to make the most of their one super soldier and eventually made him a superhero who served both as a counter-intelligence agent and a propaganda symbol to counter Nazi Germany's head of terrorist operations, the Red Skull . To that end, Rogers was given a costume modelled after the American Flag, a bulletproof steel shield, a personal sidearm and the name of Captain America. He was also given a cover identity as a clumsy infantry private at Fort Lehigh where he made friends with a teenage mascot , Bucky comics |James Buchanan ""Bucky"" Barnes . Soon, Barnes learned Roger's secret identity|dual identity and offered to keep the secret if he could become his sidekick . Cap agreed, and trained Barnes appropriately. Rogers also received a new shield made from a chance mixture of adamantium, vibranium and an unknown catalyst which formed an indestructible metal light enough to use as a discus -like weapon that could be angled to return to him. It proved so effective that the sidearm was dropped. Throughout World War II, the duo fought the Nazi menace both on their own and as members of the superhero team called the Invaders. ==1960s Revival== In '' The Avengers comics |The Avengers #4'' 1964 , the Avengers discovered Captain America's body in the Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic Ocean .

"Freeways is the sixth studio album by Canadian rock band Bachman–Turner Overdrive, released in 1977. It was their last album with Randy Bachman until seven years later when they made a reunion album in 1984. This is also the last studio album to be made with the band's classic and most successful Not Fragile line up. The album was a commercial failure, featuring the first BTO single that did not chart ('My Wheels Won't Turn'). Randy Bachman wrote every song except 'Life Still Goes On.' Many of BTO's core fans did not like the album as it was not the heavy, guitar-driven rock n' roll they were known for. Fred Turner was reportedly unhappy with this album and wouldn't allow a straight-on picture of himself to be used on the cover. Years later, Randy would agree that the Freeways album was rushed to the studio, but mentioned 'Down Down', 'Shotgun Rider', and 'My Wheels Won't Turn' as songs worthy of inclusion on any BTO album.","Bachman–Turner Overdrive's sixth studio album, 'Freeways', was released in 1977 and marked the last time Randy Bachman would be part of the band until their reunion in 1984.

The album's sound deviated from the heavy guitar-driven rock that fans were accustomed to, with many core fans expressing disappointment. Randy Bachman has since acknowledged that the album was rushed and that the band should have taken more time to develop their ideas. However, he did praise certain tracks, including 'Down Down', 'Shotgun Rider', and 'My Wheels Won't Turn', which featured a notable guitar solo by Blair Thornton.",0

" Food safety 

'''Food safety''' is a scientific discipline describing handling, food processing|preparation , and food storage|storage of food in ways that prevent foodborne illness . This includes a number of routines that should be followed to avoid potentially severe health|health hazards . In this way Food Safety often overlaps with Food Defense to prevent harm to consumers. The tracks within this line of thought are safety between industry and the market and then between the market and the consumer. In considering industry to market practices, food safety considerations include the origins of food including the practices relating to Food labelling regulations|food labeling , food hygiene , food additives and pesticide residue s, as well as policies on biotechnology and food and guidelines for the management of governmental import and export inspection and certification systems for foods. In considering market to consumer practices, the usual thought is that food ought to be safe in the market and the concern is safe delivery and preparation of the food for the consumer.

Food can transmit disease from person to person as well as serve as a growth medium for bacterium|bacteria that can cause food poisoning . In developed countries there are intricate standards for food preparation, whereas in lesser developed countries the main issue is simply the availability of adequate drinking water|safe water , which is usually a critical item.<ref> cite web | first=I.

# Prevent contaminating food with pathogen s spreading from people, pets, and pests.
# Separate raw and cooked foods to prevent contaminating the cooked foods.
# Cook foods for the appropriate length of time and at the appropriate temperature to kill pathogens.
# Store food at the proper temperature.
# Do use safe water and raw materials.

==ISO 22000==
 ISO 22000 is a standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization dealing with food safety. This is a general derivative of ISO 9000 .
ISO 22000 standard: The ISO 22000 international standard specifies the requirements for a food safety management system that involves '''interactive communication, system management, prerequisite programs, HACCP principles.'''

===WHO and FAO===
In 2003, the WHO and FAO published the Codex Alimentarius which serves as an guideline to food safety.<ref name=""cafh""> cite web |work=Codex Alimentarius |title=Codex Alimentarius and Food Hygiene |url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/codex/Publications/Booklets/Hygiene/FoodHygiene_2003e.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations |accessdate=2007-10-15 </ref>

However, according to Unit 04 - Communication of Health & Consumers Directorate-General of the European Commission SANCO :
""The Codex, while being recommendations for voluntary application by members, Codex standards serve in many cases as a basis for national legislation. The reference made to Codex food safety standards in the World Trade Organizations' Agreement on Sanitary and wiktionary:Phytosanitary|Phytosanitary measures SPS Agreement means that Codex has far reaching implications for resolving trade disputes. WTO members that wish to apply stricter food safety measures than those set by Codex may be required to justify these measures scientifically.""
So, an agreement made in 2003, signed by all member states, inclusive all EU, in the codex  Stan Codex 240 – 2003 for coconut milk, sulphite containing additives like E223 and E 224 are allowed till 30&nbsp;mg/kg, does NOT mean, they are allowed into the EU, see Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed|RASFF entries from Denmark:  2012.0834 ; 2011.1848; en 2011.168, “sulphite unauthorised in coconut milk from Thailand “.

===Australia===
 See also|Food safety in Australia 
 Food Standards Australia New Zealand requires all food businesses to implement food safety systems. These systems are designed to ensure food is safe to consume and halt the increasing incidence of food poisoning, and they include basic food safety training for at least one person in each business.
Food safety training is delivered in various forms by, among other organisations, Registered Training Organizations RTOs , after which staff are issued a nationally recognised unit of competency code on their certificate.
Basic food safety training includes:

 Understanding the hazards associated with the main types of food and the conditions to prevent the growth of bacteria which can cause food poisoning and to prevent illness.
 Potential problems associated with product packaging such as leaks in vacuum packs, damage to packaging or pest infestation, as well as problems and diseases spread by pests.
 Safe food handling. This includes safe procedures for each process such as receiving, re-packing, food storage, preparation and cooking, cooling and re-heating, displaying products, handling products when serving customers, packaging, cleaning and sanitizing, pest control, transport and delivery. Also covers potential causes of cross contamination.
 Catering for customers who are particularly at risk of food-borne illness, as well as those with allergies or intolerance.
 Correct cleaning and sanitizing procedures, cleaning products and their correct use, and the storage of cleaning items such as brushes, mops and cloths.
 Personal hygiene, hand washing, illness, and protective clothing.

Food safety standards and requirements are set out at the national level in the Food Standards Code, and brought Into force in each state by state-based Acts and Regulations. Legislation means that people responsible for selling or serving unsafe food may be liable for heavy fines.

===China===
 Main|Food safety in the People's Republic of China 

Food safety is a growing concern in Agriculture in China|Chinese agriculture . The Chinese government oversees agricultural production as well as the manufacture of food packaging , containers, chemical additives, drug production, and business regulation. In recent years, the Chinese government attempted to consolidate food regulation with the creation of the State Food and Drug Administration in 2003, and officials have also been under increasing public and international pressure to solve food safety problems. However, it appears that regulations are not well known by the trade. Labels used for ""green"" food, ""organic"" food and ""pollution-free"" food are not well recognized by traders and many are unclear about their meaning. A survey by the World Bank found that supermarket managers had difficulty in obtaining produce that met safety requirements and found that a high percentage of produce did not comply with established standards.<ref> cite web | publisher=World Bank and China Agriculture Press |year=2005 |url= |format=PDF |title=China's Compliance with Food Safety Requirements for Fruits and Vegetables: Promoting Food Safety, Competitiveness, and Poverty Reduction </ref>

Traditional marketing systems, whether in China or the rest of Asia, presently provide little motivation or incentive for individual farmers to make improvements to either quality or safety as their produce tends to get grouped together with standard products as it progresses through the marketing channel. Direct linkages between farmer groups and traders or ultimate buyers, such as supermarkets, can help avoid this problem. Governments need to improve the condition of many markets through upgrading management and reinvesting market fees in physical infrastructure. Wholesale marketing|Wholesale markets need to investigate the feasibility of developing separate sections to handle fruits and vegetables that meet defined safety and quality standards.<ref> cite web | first=Andrew W. | last=Shepherd | year=2006 | url= | format=PDF | title=Quality and safety in the traditional horticultural marketing chains of Asia |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations | location=Rome Dead link|date=March 2013 </ref>

===European Union===
The parliament of the European Union EU makes legislation in the form of directives and regulations, many of which are mandatory for member states and which therefore must be incorporated into individual countries' national legislation. As a very large organisation that exists to remove barriers to trade between member states, and into which individual member states have only a proportional influence, the outcome is often seen as an excessively bureaucratic 'one size fits all' approach. However, in relation to food safety the tendency to err on the side of maximum protection for the consumer may be seen as a positive benefit. The EU parliament is informed on food safety matters by the European Food Safety Authority .

Individual member states may also have other legislation and controls in respect of food safety, provided that they do not prevent trade with other states, and can differ considerably in their internal structures and approaches to the regulatory control of food safety.

From 13 December 2014, new legislation - the EU Food Information for Consumers Regulation 1169/2011 - require food businesses to provide allergy information on food sold unpackaged, in for example catering outlets, deli counters, bakeries and sandwich bars.<ref>

The Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection BMELV <ref> cite web |title=German Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection |url= |publisher=Bundesministerium für Ernährung, Landwirtschaft und Verbraucherschutz </ref> is a Federal Ministry of the Federal Republic of Germany.
'''History''': Founded as Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Foresting in 1949, this name did not change until 2001. Then the name changed to Federal Ministry of Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture. At the 22nd of November 2005, the name got changed again to its current state: Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection. The reason for this last change was that all the resorts should get equal ranking which was achieved by sorting the resorts alphabetically.
'''Vision''': A balanced and healthy diet with safe food, distinct consumer rights and consumer information for various areas of life, and a strong and sustainable agriculture as well as perspectives for our rural areas are important goals of the Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection BMELV .
The Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety is under the control of the Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection. It exercises several duties, with which it contributes to safer food and thereby intensifies health-based consumer protection in Germany. Food can be manufactured and sold within Germany without a special permission, as long as it does not cause any damage on consumers’ health and meets the general standards set by the legislation. However, manufacturers, carriers, importers and retailers are responsible for the food they pass into circulation. They are obliged to ensure and document the safety and quality of their food with the use of in-house control mechanisms.

The New Zealand Food Safety Authority|New Zealand Food Safety Authority NZFSA , or Te Pou Oranga Kai O Aotearoa is the New Zealand government body responsible for food safety. NZFSA is also the controlling authority for imports and exports of food and food-related products. The NZFSA as of 2012 is now a division of the Ministry for Primary Industries MPI and is no longer its own organization.

===Pakistan===
Pakistan does not have an integrated legal framework but has a set of laws, which deals with various aspects of food safety. These laws, despite the fact that they were enacted long time ago, have tremendous capacity to achieve at least minimum level of food safety. However, like many other laws, these laws remain very poorly enforced. There are four laws that specifically deal with food safety. Three of these laws directly focus issues related to food safety, while the fourth, the Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority Act, is indirectly relevant to food safety.

The Pure Food Ordinance 1960 consolidates and amends the law in relation to the preparation and the sale of foods. All provinces and some northern areas have adopted this law with certain amendments. Its aim is to ensure purity of food being supplied to people in the market and, therefore, provides for preventing adulteration. The Pure Food Ordinance 1960 does not apply to cantonment areas. There is a separate law for cantonments called ""The Cantonment Pure Food Act, 1966"". There is no substantial difference between the Pure Food Ordinance 1960 and The Cantonment Pure Food Act. Even the rules of operation are very much similar.

Pakistan Hotels and Restaurant Act, 1976 applies to all hotels and restaurants in Pakistan and seeks to control and regulate the rates and standard of service s by hotels and restaurants. In addition to other provisions, under section 22 2 , the sale of food or beverages that are contaminated, not prepared hygienically or served in utensils that are not hygienic or clean is an offense. There are no express provisions for consumer complaints in the Pakistan Restaurants Act, 1976, Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 and Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority Act, 1996. The laws do not prevent citizens from lodging complaints with the concerned government officials; however, the consideration and handling of complaints is a matter of discretion of the officials.<ref> cite web | first=Mazhar | last=Siraj | year=2004 | url= | format=DOC | title=Food Safety Legislation in Pakistan | publisher=Consumer Rights Commission of Pakistan </ref>

==== Federal level regulation ====
The Food and Drug Administration publishes the Food Code, a model set of guidelines and procedures that assists food control jurisdictions by providing a scientifically sound technical and legal basis for regulating the retail and food service industries, including restaurants, grocery stores and institutional foodservice providers such as nursing homes . Regulatory agencies at all levels of government in the United States use the FDA Food Code to develop or update food safety rules in their jurisdictions that are consistent with national food regulatory policy. According to the FDA, 48 of 56 states and US Territories|territories , representing 79% of the U.S. population, have adopted food codes patterned after one of the five versions of the Food Code, beginning with the 1993 edition.<ref> cite web |url= |title=FDA Food Code |author= |publisher= Food and Drug Administration |date=2007-10-05 |accessdate=2008-09-01 |quote= </ref>

In the United States, federal regulations governing food safety are fragmented and complicated, according to a February 2007 report from the Government Accountability Office.<ref> cite web |url= |format=PDF |volume=GAO-07-449T | title=High-Risk Designation Can Bring Needed Attention to Fragmented System | work=Federal Oversight of Food Safety |publisher=Government Accountability Office </ref> There are 15 agencies sharing oversight responsibilities in the food safety system, although the two primary agencies are the U.S. Department of Agriculture USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS , which is responsible for the safety of meat, poultry, and processed egg products, and the Food and Drug Administration FDA , which is responsible for virtually all other foods.

The Food Safety and Inspection Service has approximately 7,800 inspection program personnel working in nearly 6,200 federally inspected meat, poultry and processed egg establishments. FSIS is charged with administering and enforcing the Federal Meat Inspection Act , the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Egg Products Inspection Act, portions of the Agricultural Marketing Act , the Humane Slaughter Act , and the regulations that implement these laws. FSIS inspection program personnel inspect every animal before slaughter, and each carcass after slaughter to ensure public health requirements are met. In fiscal year FY 2008, this included about 50 billion pounds of livestock carcasses, about 59 billion pounds of poultry carcasses, and about 4.3 billion pounds of processed egg products. At U.S. borders, they also inspected 3.3 billion pounds of imported meat and poultry products.<ref> cite web |url= |format=PDF |title=FSIS Testimony, March 11, 2009 |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service </ref>

=====Industry pressure=====
There have been concerns over the efficacy of safety practices and food industry pressure on U.S. regulators. A study reported by Reuters found that ""the food industry is jeopardizing U.S. public health by withholding information from food safety investigators or pressuring regulators to withdraw or alter policy designed to protect consumers"". A survey found that 25% of U.S. government inspectors and scientists surveyed have experienced during the past year corporate interests forcing their food safety agency to withdraw or to modify agency policy or action that protects consumers. Scientists have observed that management undercuts field inspectors who stand up for food safety against industry pressure. According to Dr. Dean Wyatt, a USDA veterinarian who oversees federal slaughter house inspectors, ""Upper level management does not adequately support field inspectors and the actions they take to protect the food supply. Not only is there lack of support, but there's outright obstruction, retaliation and abuse of power.""<ref> cite web | agency=Reuters | title=Industry Has Sway Over Food Safety System: U.S. Study | url= | date=2010-09-14 | archiveurl= | archivedate=2010-09-14 </ref> A growing number of food and beverage manufacturers are improving food safety standards by incorporating a food safety management system which automates all steps in the food quality management process.<ref> cite web|last1=Kuchinski|first1=Kelly|title=Can Automation Reduce the Risk of Food Recalls?|url= July 2015 </ref>

====State and local regulation====
A number of U.S. States of the United States|states have their own meat inspection programs that substitute for USDA inspection for meats that are sold only in-state.<ref> cite web |url= |title=FSIS State Inspection Programs | publisher=United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service </ref> Certain state programs have been criticized for undue leniency to bad practices.<ref> cite web |url= |format=PDF |title=USDA Allowed State Meat Inspection Programs To Operate Even After Finding Cutting Boards Contaminated With Old Meat And Soot-Like Residues On Swine Carcasses |publisher=Consumer Federation of America |date=2006-09-28 </ref>

However, other state food safety programs supplement, rather than replace, Federal inspections, generally with the goal of increasing consumer confidence in the state's produce. For example, state health departments have a role in investigating outbreaks of food-borne disease bacteria, as in the case of the 2006 outbreak of Escherichia coli O157:H7|''Escherichia coli'' O157:H7 a pathogenic strain of the ordinarily harmless bacteria, ''E. coli'' from processed spinach.<ref> cite web |url= |title=State Health Department announces test results match genetic fingerprints to E. coli outbreak | work=Press releases | quote=ben 0987, 8765 | publisher=California Department of Health Services | date=2006-10-12 | archiveurl= | archivedate=2006-11-07 | deadurl=yes </ref> Health departments also promote better food processing practices to eliminate these threats.<ref> cite web |url= |title=CDHS Education Training Unit |publisher=California Department of Health Services </ref>

In addition to the US Food and Drug Administration , several states that are major producers of fresh fruits and vegetables including California, Arizona and Florida have their own state programs to test produce for pesticide residues.<ref> cite web |url= |format=PDF |title=Pesticides and food: How we test for safety |publisher=California Department of Pesticide Regulation |date=June 2003 </ref>

Restaurants and other retail food establishments fall under state law and are regulated by state or local health departments. Typically these regulations require official inspections of specific design features, best food-handling practices, and certification of food handlers.<ref> cite web |url= |title=New York Restaurant Inspection Information |publisher=The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene |archiveurl= / |archivedate=2005-12-15 |deadurl=yes </ref> In some places a letter grade or numerical score must be prominently posted following each inspection.<ref> cite web |url= |title=NYC Health Dept.

===Vietnam===
The Vietnam Food Administration is responsible for managing food hygiene, safety, and quality and has made significant progress since its establishment in 1999. Food safety remains a high priority in Vietnam with the growth of export markets and increasing food imports raising the need to rapidly build capacity of the Food Administration in order to reduce threats of foodborne disease. The Food Administration has demonstrated commitment to the food safety challenges it faces, and has embarked on an innovative capacity building activity with technical assistance from the World Health Organization .<ref>

==Consumer labeling==

=== United Kingdom ===
Foodstuffs in the UK have one of two labels to indicate the nature of the deterioration of the product and any subsequent health issues. EHO Food Hygiene certification is required to prepare and distribute food. While there is no specified expiry date of such a qualification the changes in legislation it is suggested to update every five years.

''' Shelf life|Best before ''' indicates a future date beyond which the food product ''may'' lose quality in terms of taste or texture amongst others, but does not imply any serious health problems if food is consumed beyond this date within reasonable limits .

'''Use by''' indicates a legal date beyond which it is not permissible to sell a food product usually one that deteriorates fairly rapidly after production due to the potential serious nature of consumption of pathogens. Leeway is sometimes provided by producers in stating '''display until''' dates so that products are not at their limit of safe consumption on the actual date stated this latter is voluntary and not subject to regulatory control . This allows for the variability in production, storage and display methods.

===United States===
With the exception of infant formula and baby foods which must be withdrawn by their expiration date, Federal law does not require expiration dates. For all other foods, except dairy products in some states, freshness dating is strictly voluntary on the part of manufacturers. In response to consumer demand, perishable foods are typically labelled with a '''Sell by''' date.<ref> cite web |url= |title=Expiration, Use-by, and Sell-by Dates, Part 1: Expiration dating is not federally required on all products |publisher=About.com |work=Home Cooking </ref> It is up to the consumer to decide how long after the Sell by date a package is usable.

"Humphrey was the son of Humphrey III of Toron|Humphrey , heir to Humphrey II of Toron , and Stephanie of Milly . sfn|Runciman|1989a|p=396, Appendix III Genealogical tree No. 4. He was born in about 1165. sfn|Hamilton|2000|p=161 Humphrey was still a child when his father died around 1173. sfn|Runciman|1989a|p=396 sfn|Hamilton|2000|p=92 Before long, Humpherey's mother inherited the Oultrejordain|Lordship of Oultrejourdan . sfn|Hamilton|2000|p=92 She married Miles of Plancy , Seneschal of Jerusalem , but he was murdered in October 1174. sfn|Runciman|1989a|p=405 sfn|Hamilton|2000|pp=90, 92 Next year, she married Raynald of Châtillon . sfn|Runciman|1989a|pp=406, 408 Humphrey inherited the Lordship of Toron after his grandfather died of wounds received in the Battle of Banyas on 22 April 1179. sfn|Runciman|1989a|pp=419, 424 
In 1180 he became betrothed to Isabella of Jerusalem , daughter of Amalric I of Jerusalem|Amalric I and half-sister to Baldwin, under the agreement that Toron would become a royal territory. This was arranged by the king to repay his debt of honour to Humphrey II, and to remove Isabella from the political camp of her stepfather, Balian of Ibelin . She does not seem to have been allowed to contact with her parents after this. In November 1183 the teenage Humphrey and the eleven-year-old Isabella were married in the fortress of Kerak the seat of the lordship of Oultrejourdain , which was Siege of Kerak|besieged by Saladin shortly afterwards. Humphrey's mother convinced Saladin not to bombard the tower in which the newly married young couple were lodged, although he continued to besiege the rest of the fortress; Kerak was eventually relieved by King Baldwin IV.
Isabella's mother Maria, stepfather Balian and other prominent nobles, including Reginald of Sidon , now supported Conrad of Montferrat , Baldwin V's uncle, whose arrival in 1187 had saved the city of Tyre Lebanon |Tyre and, indeed, the kingdom. They determined that Isabella should be divorced from Humphrey in order to marry Conrad. Isabella protested because Humphrey had always been kind to her. Despite this, she was abducted from her husband and pressed by her mother to agree to an ecclesiastical annulment, on the grounds that she had married Humphrey when underage and had been coerced by the will of her half-brother King Baldwin IV. Humphrey was challenged to a trial by combat by Guy of Senlis, the Butler of France, over the issue of Isabella's consent to the marriage, but he refused to fight for her - possibly because she had indeed been under twelve years of age. Even Humphrey's sympathisers, such as the author of the ''Itinerarium Peregrinorum et Gesta Regis Ricardi'' regarded him as weak and rather effeminate.","Humphrey was the son of Humphrey III of Toron and Stephanie of Milly.

The next year, she married Raynald of Châtillon. Humphrey inherited the Lordship of Toron after his grandfather's death in the Battle of Banyas on April 22, 1179. In October 1180, Isabella I of Jerusalem was betrothed to Humphrey. According to the marriage contract, Humphrey renounced his inherited domains in exchange for a money fief of 7,000 bezants. This provision suggests that King Baldwin IV wanted to prevent Humphrey from uniting two large fiefs. In November 1183, Humphrey and Isabella were married in Kerak, but their marriage was later annulled due to Isabella's underage status and coercion by her half-brother King Baldwin IV.",0

"Before the invention of printing, the Church controlled all opinion distasteful to her. With the printing press, German printers established themselves in western Europe, where copyists multiplied manuscripts. In 1473, Louis XI granted letters patent to Uldaric Quring, who had set up a press in the Sorbonne three years earlier. Paris soon had over fifty presses at work. The Church and universities found book output beyond their control. Pope Alexander VI restricted printing in 1496 and issued a bull against unlicensed printing in 1501. Between 1524 and 1548, the Imperial Diet drew up regulations, while France prohibited book printing under penalty of death.

"A thermostat is a component that senses the temperature of a system and maintains it near a desired setpoint by switching heating or cooling devices on or off. Thermostats are used in various devices, including building heating systems, air conditioners, HVAC systems, kitchen equipment, medical incubators, and scientific incubators. They can be constructed using different sensors, such as thermistors or bimetallic strips, to measure temperature. The thermostat's output controls the heating or cooling apparatus, typically operating in a bang-bang control mode where the equipment runs at full capacity until the set temperature is reached. Some thermostats have a maximum switching frequency to prevent equipment damage from frequent switching.","A '''thermostat''' is a component which senses the temperature of a system so that the system's temperature is maintained near a desired ''setpoint''. 
A thermostat can be is often the main control unit for a heating or cooling system, in applications ranging from ambient air control, to such as automotive coolant control, but is also used in used in many other applications, such as an electric clothes iron. 
 
It is a ""closed loop"" control device, as it seeks to reduce the error between the desired and measured temperatures. Often they combine both the sensing and control action elements of control system, such as in an automotive thermostat. 

=Overview=
A thermostat exerts control by switching heating or cooling devices on or off, or by regulating the flow of a heat transfer fluid as needed, to maintain the correct temperature. Thermostats are used in any device or system that heats or cools to a setpoint temperature, examples include building heating , central heating , air conditioning|air conditioners , HVAC systems, as well as kitchen equipment including oven s and refrigerator s and medical and scientific incubator culture |incubator s.
==Construction==
Thermostats can be constructed in many ways and may use a variety of sensor s to measure the temperature, commonly a thermistor or bimetallic strip . The output of the sensor then controls the heating or cooling apparatus. A thermostat is most often an instance of a "" Bang–bang control|bang-bang controller "" as the heating or cooling equipment interface is not typically controlled in a proportional manner to the difference between actual temperature and the temperature setpoint . Instead, the heating or cooling equipment runs at full capacity until the set temperature is reached, then shuts off. Increasing the difference between the thermostat setting and the desired temperature therefore does not shorten the time to achieve the desired temperature. A thermostat may have a maximum switching frequency, or switch heating and cooling equipment on and off at temperatures either side of the setpoint. This reduces the risk of equipment damage from frequent switching.",1

"Mustafa Kemal Ataturk was born in the early months of 1881, either in the Ahmed Subasi neighbourhood or at a house (preserved as a museum) in Islahhane Street (now Apostolou Pavlou Street) in the Koca Kasim Pasha neighbourhood in Thessaloniki, Ottoman Empire (Thessaloniki in present-day Greece), to Zubeyde Hanim, a housewife, and Ali Riza Efendi, a militia officer, title-deed clerk and lumber trader. Only one of Mustafa's siblings, a sister named Makbule (Atadan) survived childhood; she died in 1956. According to Andrew Mango, his family was Muslim, Turkish-speaking and precariously middle-class. His father Ali Riza is thought to have been of Albanian origin by some authors; however, according to many more references as Falih Rifki Atay, Vamik D. Volkan, Norman Itzkowitz, Mujgan Cunbur, Numan Kartal and Hasan Izzettin Dinamo, Ali Riza's ancestors were Turks, ultimately descending from Soke in the Aydin Province of Anatolia. His mother Zubeyde is thought to have been of Turkish origin and according to Sevket Sureyya Aydemir, she was of Yoruk ancestry. Due to the sizeable minority of Jews in Selanik during the Ottoman period, many of Ataturk's Islamist opponents have eagerly claimed that he may have had Donmeh ancestors (Jews who converted to Islam during the Ottoman period). However, his grandparents were not native to Selanik, and his family had moved to this city from other provinces of the Ottoman Empire. There are also some suggestions about the possibility of his Slavic origin, based on his light skin complexion, blond hair and blue eyes.","Mustafa Kemal Ataturk was born in 1881, either in Thessaloniki or at a house preserved as a museum in Islahhane Street now Apostolou Pavlou Street in the Koca Kasim Pasha neighbourhood.

 The two castles named Muckinish ''Muck inis'', Irish for pig island were reportedly built within three years of each other in the 15th century ''Nua'' means new, ''Sean'' means old . As of 1897, Muckinish Nua or Muckinish Noe , on the bay of Pouldoody, was badly damaged. Seanmuckinish or Shan Muckinish was repaired around 1836, and as of 1897 was habitable. sfn|Frost|1897 The ''National Inventory of Architectural Heritage'' describes the latter as: ""remains of free-standing square-plan single bay four-storey rubble stone-built tower house, c. 1450."" Both ruins reach almost to their original height of around 17 m and are partially collapsed, exposing a cross-sectional view of the interior floors. Due to the similarities of their names the chronology of ownership is confused. Seanmuckinish was also known for a time as Ballynacragga Castle. This may be an indication that the MacNamara family lived here, bringing the name of their family castle near Dromoland Castle from which they were expelled in 1654. Otherwise, both Muckinish castles were inhabited up to the 19th century by members of the Uí Lochlainn|O'Loghlen , Neylon and Blake families.<ref name=""Inventory""> cite web|url= Inventory of Architectural Heritage - Muckinish Castle, County Clare|publisher=Department of Arts, Heritage & the Gaeltacht|date=|first=|last=|accessdate=11 October 2016 </ref><ref name=""Arch""> cite book|last=Carthy|first=Hugh|title=Burren Archaeology|publisher=The Collins Press|year=2011|isbn=9781848891050|page= </ref> rp|81-4

The ideas flow gently from one to the next, ultimately leading to the trumpet cadenza.

"An electric musical instrument, such as an electric guitar or bass guitar, may have a kill switch, also known as a stutter switch. Typically used by heavy metal music and hardcore punk guitarists, it works by switching between the hot signal from a pickup and the ground signal without breaking the circuit. A common way to achieve this is on a guitar with a volume control for each pickup by turning down one of the pickups' volumes then alternating the pickup selector switch between that pickup and one with its volume turned up. Kill switches are also used as a special effect during a song, allowing a guitarist to play a chord or note that 'stutters' on and off in a rhythmic fashion. They're rarely found in consumer-grade instruments but can be installed by custom guitar shops or built into an effects pedal controlled by a foot switch.","An electric musical instrument, such as an electric guitar or bass guitar, may have a kill switch, also known as a stutter switch.

"In the current Marvel Universe history, Steve Rogers was a sickly United States|American fine arts student specializing in illustration in the early 1940s before America's entry into World War II . He was disturbed by the rise of the Third Reich enough to attempt to enlist only to be rejected due to his poor constitution. By chance, an United States Army|Army officer looking for test subjects for a top secret defense research project offered Rogers an alternate way to serve his country. The officer was looking for suitable test subjects for a top secret defense research project, Operation: Rebirth. This project consisted of developing a means to create physically superior soldiers and Rogers was deemed ideal. Rogers agreed to volunteer for the research and after a rigorous physical and combat training and selection process, was chosen as the first human test subject. He received injections and oral ingestions of a chemical formula that was termed the Super Soldier Serum, which had been developed by the scientist Dr Emil Erskine who was code-named Dr Reinstein . Rogers was then exposed to a controlled burst of ""Vita-Rays"" that activated the chemicals in his system. Although the process was arduous physically, it successfully altered his physiognomy from his relative frail form to the maximum of human efficiency, including greatly enhanced musculature and reflexes. Unfortunately at this moment of triumph, a Nazi secret agent|spy revealed himself and shot Erskine. Because the scientist had committed the crucial portions of the Super Solder formula to memory, it could not be duplicated. Rogers killed the spy in retaliation and vowed to oppose the enemies of America. Meanwhile, the US government decided to make the most of their one super soldier and eventually made him a superhero who served both as a counter-intelligence agent and a propaganda symbol to counter Nazi Germany's head of terrorist operations, the Red Skull . To that end, Rogers was given a costume modelled after the American Flag, a bulletproof steel shield, a personal sidearm and the name of Captain America. He was also given a cover identity as a clumsy infantry private at Fort Lehigh where he made friends with a teenage mascot , Bucky comics |James Buchanan ""Bucky"" Barnes . Soon, Barnes learned Roger's secret identity|dual identity and offered to keep the secret if he could become his sidekick . Cap agreed, and trained Barnes appropriately. Rogers also received a new indestructible shield made from a chance mixture of iron and vibranium , light enough to use as a discus -like weapon that could be angled to return to him. It proved so effective that the sidearm was dropped.

The observed electron energy spectrum was continuous. Assuming energy conservation, this is only possible if beta decay is a three-body rather than a two-body process: the latter produces a monochromatic peak rather than a continuous energy spectrum.

Jenkins was raised in Pampa, Texas where he was an all - round athlete, becoming one of the nation's' highly recruited football and baseball players while performing under legendary high school coach, Swede Lee .<ref> cite news |title=John Jenkins brings his style and brand of football to the Renegades |author= Canwest News Service |url= |newspaper= |publisher=CanWest MediaWorks Publications Inc. |date=November 13, 2005 |accessdate=February 10, 2012 </ref> His playing career revealed him being a 2 sport standout college football and baseball at the University of Arkansas . In football, performing for the legendary Arkansas coach, Frank Broyles, Jenkins was selected by the Southwest Conference media & sportswriters as the "" Most Versatile Player in the SWC "" in 1971 due to his starting role as running back, special teams captain, emergency roles at Quarterback and receiver . He was part of a starting backfield that included future NFL star QB, Joe Ferguson and Dickey Morton, who teamed up to set all - time school records in total offense and scoring marks during the 1971 season. That 1971 Razorback team earned a trip to the Liberty Bowl . Knowing at an early age that he would enter the football coaching profession Jenkins was practically a player - coach during his college playing career, always hanging out at the coaches offices during his free time, quizzing various assistants about different theories . He would often bring in his own designed offensive plays, diagrammed on pizza boxes or brown grocery sacks to get the valuable input and reaction from his coaches . In baseball Jenkins was selected by his teammates as their MVP after establishing season records for the school in hits, total bases, as he was one of the top power hitters in the SWC and the nation .He was selected with a number of post season honors in 1974 and declined minor league contract offers to immediately begin a football coaching career .
After serving as the special teams coach for the Houston Gamblers of the USFL in 1984, Jenkins was promoted to offensive coordinator in 1985 with the departure of Mouse Davis , who moved to the Denver Gold as head coach. Jenkins kept the run and shoot offense that Davis has installed, but modified the offense into his own version as well as geadually departing to his own play design . In Jenkins' debut as offensive coordinator against Steve Young and the Los Angeles Express USFL |Los Angeles Express , the Gamblers trailed 33–13 with eight minutes left in the fourth quarter. Employing a hurry-up offense , the Gamblers came back to win the game 34–33. Since the game was not televised, '' Sports Illustrated '' dubbed it ""The Greatest Game Never Seen"". Legendary coach, George Allen, who was at this game doing USFL radio commentary, declared afterwards that this was the first time that a pro team on any level had ever utilized a hurry - up offensive approach outside of the final 2 minutes of the game or prior to the half .
In the fourth week of the 1985 season, the Gamblers met Davis' Denver Gold in the first game ever to pit two run and shoot offenses. The two offenses showed only small similarities as Jenkins employed various new tactics such as motioning receivers out of the backfield, going into empty sets as well as introducing new play design that he had held out for this match - up . The Gamblers won 36–17.
At this point in this season quarterback Jim Kelly was on pace to finish the season with 7,434 yards and 78 touchdowns. But due to a leg injury, he missed six games of the regular season and he fell well short of those marks. However, Kelly and his backup, Todd Dillon, combined 6,118 yards passing on the season, a record for professional American football. The Gamblers offense also featured three receivers— Clarence Verdin , Gerald McNeil , and Richard Johnson wide receiver |Richard Johnson —that each totaled over 1,000 yards, a first in professional football. The Gamblers made the playoffs with a 10–8 record, and lost to the Birmingham Stallions , 22–20.
Jenkins moved to the University of Houston and joined the Houston Cougars football staff as the offensive coordinator in 1987. There he inherited a veer option offense featuring Andre Ware , who only threw one touchdown pass his entire high school career, and converted it into the most prolific passing attack in college football history. During Jenkins' entire period as offensive coordinator and head coach his explosive Houston offense established and re - established over 300 all - time offensive team and individual NCAA major college records . Many of these all - time marks from the late 1980s and the early 1990s still remain today . As a rare Quarterback - Receiver specialist Jenkins' pupils Andre Ware, David Klingler, Donald Douglas and Jimmy Klingler at the U. Of Houston all held their share of newly established NCAA passing, scoring and total offense records .
When Jenkins joined the Cougars, he had further developed his offense from a pure run and shoot attack into what he referred to as the ""Multiple Adjusting Passing Offense"" or ""MAPO"".<ref name=sportsillustrated/> Jenkins' new offense made an immediate impact in the Southwest Conference as Houston beat the Texas Longhorns football|Texas Longhorns handily in each of his first three seasons: 60–40 in 1987, 66–15 in 1988, and 47–9 in 1989. In 1988, Jason Phillips and James Dixon became the first two college football receivers to finish a season with over 100 catches. In 1989, Houston scored over 40 points in nine of their 11 games, including a 95–21 rout of SMU Mustangs football|SMU in which they racked up 1,021 yards of offense. Ware finished the season with 4,699 yards and 44 touchdowns, set 26 National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA records, and won the Heisman Trophy . The 1989 Houston offense averaged 53.5 points per game, 624.9 total yards per game and 10.1 yards rushing per carry, hover 511 yards passing per game, all national records.
In 1990, Cougars head coach Jack Pardee left the team to take the head coaching position with the National Football League 's Houston Oilers . Jenkins was promoted to head coach of the Cougars. With Ware gone, David Klingler took over at quarterback and continued the success of Jenkins' passing attack. Klingler threw for over 400 yards in nine of 11 games in 1990, including a 716-yard performance against Arizona State Sun Devils football|Arizona State in the Coca-Cola Classic college football |Coca-Cola Classic . He averaged 474.6 yards a game, a national record. Klingler also broke the national record for most touchdown passes in a game with 11 against Eastern Washington Eagles football|Eastern Washington . He completed the season with 5,140 yards and 54 touchdowns, outpacing Ware's totals from 1989, but fell short in the Heisman race, finishing fifth behind winner Ty Detmer and three others. Houston finished the season 10–1. Jenkins' Houston team had climbed as high as 3rd in the nation, held the nations' longest win streak while making a run for the national championship .Their only loss came against Texas in the 9th fame of the season . The Cougars were not allowed to go to a bowl game due to NCAA sanctions for violations under former coach Bill Yeoman . Jenkins' teams featured the nation's leading receiver each year from 1987 to 1992.

During Jenkins' stint as head coach of the U. Of Houston he remained as an offensive consultant to Jack Pardee's NFL, Houston Oilers . Jenkins had served Pardee as his offensive coordinator in 4 various jobs . Pardee often referred to John Jenkins as the finest coach he had ever been associated with .
After leaving Houston, Jenkins went to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League CFL during the 1993 and 1994 seasons . From there he moved to the USA expansion Birmingham Barracudas for the 1995 season as their Offensive coordinator, employing his updated CFL aerial raid versions . Upon the CFL commissioner's decision to fold the USA franchises and pull back completely to Canada Jenkins went to the Hamilton Tiger - Cats as their offensive coordinator . He left Hamilton after one season to re - join his 2 Heisman Trophy winning QB's Doug Flutie & Andre Ware with the Toronto Argonauts as the offensive coordinator. There Jenkins installed another wide - open offense built around the strengths of star quarterback, Doug Flutie . The Argonauts won the Grey Cup in 1997 and this team is still referred by many today as the most powerful team and explosive offense in the overall history of the CFL . His offensive superlatives continued at Toronto with his next star QB, Kerwin Bell, who under Jenkins' guidance, broke the CFL league record for completion percentage in a season, in addition to the offense breaking league records for the most passes completed in a single season, as well as other league superlatives .

After Jenkins departed briefly from the CFL he served a brief stint in the Arena Football League in 1999 and 2000, bringing a new "" flavor "" of indoor pro football to the state of Arkansas, becoming the GM & head coach of the expansion Arkansas Twisters . The veteran coaches from this league thought they would easily route Jenkins' expansion forces, but Jenkins came out of the tunnel blazing in his opener rolling an 88 to 13 victory ; a sign of more to come as Jenkins registered typical offensive records and victories . His Arena indoor show packed the seats of the newly built North Little Rock arena revealing a 9 - 7 winning record as well as leading the entire nation in per game attendance based on the USA number of 32 total arena teams at that time .

Jenkins returned to the CFL Toronto Argonauts with his relentless aerial show in 2001 and 2002 . Surprisingly Jenkins also produced the leagues leading rusher in 2001 Michael Jenkins , who also set a Toronto team record in rushing yards that season . Upon Toronto acquiring new ownership Jenkins held out during the 2003 season, working as an offensive consultant and scouting assistant for a number of NFL and CFL teams . He later joined the Calgary Stampeders in 2004 as their offensive coordinator and remained there for only one season, as their ownership collapsed upon the close of the season.

In 2005 Jenkins joined long - time coaching associate and pro football Hall of Famer, Forrest Gregg, while Gregg served as the Vice - President of football operations of the CFL Ottawa Renegades, initially hiring Jenkins as his Director of USA scouting and overall personnel director . Upon the conclusion of the season Gregg held a national Canadian press conference and announced Jenkins as his next head coach of the Ottawa Renegades . When Gregg was asked by the media why he was so quick to name Jenkins as the new head coach Gregg responded by saying that he acted on this quickly because Vince Lombardi and Tom Landry was not available . In 2006 Jenkins and Gregg went on an off season of barnstorming across Canada and the USA executing tryout camps, picking up talented NFL free agents and CFL free agents for the 2006 season. Unfortunately, the team folded operations at the nation's capital due to the team's minority ownership backing out of the financial responsibilities prior to the opening of the season .

"Snake venom is a form of saliva that has been modified into venom over its evolutionary history. In snakes, venom has evolved to kill or subdue prey, as well as perform other diet-related functions. The traditional view of this evolution is that venom originated just once among all Toxicofera approximately 170 million years ago and diversified into the wide range of venoms seen today. The original toxicoferan venom was a simple set of proteins assembled in a pair of glands, which subsequently diversified in various lineages of toxicoferans. Several snake lineages have lost the ability to produce venom due to changes in diet. The evolution of venom is thought to be responsible for the enormous expansion of snakes across the globe. In most cases, the mechanism of evolution has been gene duplication followed by natural selection for adaptive traits. This process has led to various adaptations, including venom more toxic to specific prey and proteins that pre-digest prey.","Snake venom is a form of saliva that has been modified into venom over its evolutionary history.

"When plasma sodium levels rise, vasopressin neurons also fire in bursts, but these are longer and less intense than those of oxytocin neurons. Unlike oxytocin cells, vasopressin cells do not synchronize their activity. This results in continuous vasopressin secretion into the blood, rather than a pulsatile release. Researchers, including Richard Dyball, suggested that this 'phasic firing' pattern could be effective for causing vasopressin secretion. They demonstrated this by studying vasopressin secretion from an isolated posterior pituitary gland in vitro. The results showed that phasic stimulation led to significantly more hormone release than continuous stimulation.","In response to a rise in plasma sodium concentration, vasopressin neurons discharge action potentials in bursts that are longer and less intense than those of oxytocin neurons.

"The Kiev class was first laid down in 1970, partially based on a design for a full-deck carrier proposed in Project Orel.

The foredeck was equipped with heavy surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missile armament. The intended mission of the Kiev class was to support strategic missile submarines, other surface ships, and naval aviation, while also engaging in anti-aircraft, anti-submarine, and surface warfare. Four Kiev-class carriers were built and commissioned, serving in the Soviet and then Russian Navy. Three were decommissioned, with one scrapped and two sold as recreational pieces to China. The fourth ship, Admiral Gorshkov, was sold to the Indian Navy in 2004 and is currently in active service as INS Vikramaditya after extensive modifications and refurbishment.","The Kiev class was first laid down in 1970, partially based on a design for a full-deck carrier proposed in Project Orel.

"In the early Byzantine period, there were 43 Jewish communities in Palestine. During the Islamic Golden Age and Crusades, there were 50 communities, including Jerusalem, Tiberias, Ramla, Ashkelon, Caesarea, and Gaza. In the 14th century Ottoman Period, there were 30 communities, including Haifa, Nablus, Hebron, Jaffa, and Safed. By the end of the 16th century, Safed had a population of 30,000 Jews after the expulsion of Sephardim from Iberia. The 16th century saw many Ashkenazi Kabbalists drawn to the mystical aura of Safed. In Arab-Muslim territories, including most of Spain and North Africa, Jewish conditions were generally easier than in Europe.","Jewish communities continued to exist in Palestine, albeit in relatively small numbers. During the Byzantine period (6th century), there were 43 communities. The Islamic Golden Age and Crusades saw an increase to 50 communities, including Jerusalem, Tiberias, Ramla, Ashkelon, Caesarea, and Gaza. In the early Ottoman era (14th century), 30 communities remained, with Haifa, Nablus, Hebron, Jaffa, and Safed among them. The majority of Jews during this time resided in Iberia (Spain and Portugal) and Mesopotamia/Persia (Iran and Iraq). A significant population also existed in central Europe, known as Ashkenazim. Following the Alhambra decree's expulsion of Sephardim from Iberia in the 15th century, many migrated to the Ottoman Empire, swelling communities in Palestine. By the end of the 16th century, Safed had reached 30,000 Jews. The 16th century also saw Ashkenazi Kabbalists drawn to the mystical aura of Jerusalem. Johnson notes that Jewish conditions were generally easier in Arab-Muslim territories than in Europe.",0

In the summer, temperatures average from nightly lows of convert|45|°F|°C|abbr=on to daytime highs of 75&nbsp;°F 7 – 24&nbsp;°C .

The area was settled primarily during the late 19th and early 20th centuries by people arriving on the first railroad through the uninhabited Adirondack wilderness. Early trappers and hunters of the Adirondacks became guides there, eventually establishing permanent camps and hotels. Businessmen, in the style of the Great Camp Sagamore|Great Camps of the Vanderbilt family|Vanderbilts and J. P. Morgan|Morgans , built private summer homes and brought their families. Some of these lodges still exist and the Big Moose Lake area is historically significant for its unique architecture utilizing vertical half-log construction in lodges and cabins. 
Big Moose Lake was the setting of '' An American Tragedy '', a novel by Theodore Dreiser . It is based on the true story of Chester Gillette, who was convicted and executed for the drowning of Grace Brown in the South Bay of Big Moose Lake in the first part of the 20th century. The name Dreiser gave the lake where the murder took place was Big Bittern Lake, although he did visit Big Moose Lake and used it as a model for his fictional version. The Academy Award winning film, '' A Place in the Sun film |A Place in the Sun '', starring Elizabeth Taylor , Shelley Winters and Montgomery Clift , is based on the book. The murder of Grace Brown continues to gain notoriety as claims of ghost sightings around the lake occur. In 1996, the television series '' Unsolved Mysteries '' aired an  episode reenacting the tragedy, focusing on two such sighting incidents. On July 11, 2006 a wreath-laying ceremony took place on South Bay in observance of the centennial of Brown's death. A small flotilla of watercraft participated.
A historical novel by Jennifer Donnelly , '' A Northern Light '' 2003 , also takes its plot from the murder, but is told from the perspective of a young girl working at the Glenmore a lodge on the Lake. The lake and the surrounding community also play a prominent role in Robert Tucker's 2013 novel, Sasquatch Camp.

Higher ranking positions included apostle and prophet as stated in Ephesians 4:11. The term 'evangelist' is no longer used as a ministerial title in the Grace Communion International, but some denominations with roots in the former organization still use it. Raymond F. McNair was an Ambassador Class of 1953 graduate who worked under Armstrong and held various positions including Deputy Chancellor of Ambassador College Bricket Wood, UK from 1960 to 1987. He later served as Regional Head in New Zealand, Fiji, Tonga etc before leaving the WCG due to major doctrinal changes and attending other organizations including the Church of God, a Christian Fellowship and the Living Church of God. McNair then became founder and president of the Church of God 21st Century and authored the book 'Ascent to Greatness'.","Historically, in the former Worldwide Church of God, an 'evangelist' was a high-ranking minister under the governance of the Pastor General and acknowledged as an apostle.

"An axial flow turbine operates in the reverse of an axial compressor. A set of static guide vanes or nozzle vanes accelerates and adds swirl to the fluid, directing it to the next row of turbine blades mounted on a turbine rotor.

When the pressure drop is large, it cannot be used in one turbine stage. A single stage utilizing a large pressure drop would have an impractically high peripheral speed of its rotor. Therefore, machines with large pressure drops employ more than one stage.

There are two major problems in velocity-compounded stages: The nozzles must be of the convergent-divergent type for generating high supersonic steam velocity. This results in a more expensive and difficult design of the nozzle blade rows.

The blade-to-gas speed ratio parameter, velocity ratio σ = u/c2, can be used to plot efficiencies of turbine stages. Such plots for impulse and reaction stages are shown.","An '''axial turbine''' is a turbine in which the flow of the working fluid is parallel to the shaft, as opposed to radial turbine s, where the fluid runs around a shaft, as in a watermill .

"Around 1809, Sequoyah was inspired by European written languages and began creating a writing system for the Cherokee language. He initially attempted to create characters for each word but realized this would be too difficult. Instead, he created characters to represent syllables, taking some ideas from his Bible copy. The simplicity of Roman letters influenced his design, making it easier to write in print. Although he couldn't read the letters himself, as seen in certain characters that resemble Ws or 4s, he developed a well-structured system. It took him twelve years to complete, and he dropped or modified most of the original characters. By 1824, most Cherokees could read and write using their newly created orthography. Some of Sequoyah's contemporaries recognized the syllabary's value immediately. Albert Gallatin believed it was superior to the English alphabet, noting that while Cherokee students must learn 85 characters instead of 26, they can read immediately. In a few weeks, Cherokee students could accomplish what English writing students take two years to learn. The order and shapes of the characters were modified in 1828 by Elias Boudinot to adapt it for printing presses. The new system allowed the Cherokee to maintain their social boundaries and ethnic identities. Worcester made changes to several characters in 1834 to improve readability, notably inverting the 'do' character so it wouldn't be confused with the 'go' character. The syllabary remained largely unchanged until the advent of new typesetting technologies in the 20th century. It quickly gained popularity and was adopted by newspapers like the Cherokee Phoenix and the Cherokee Messenger. Today, the syllabary is still used to write letters, keep diaries, record medical formulas, transcribe recipes, and more. In the 1960s, literature was published in the Cherokee syllabary, including the Cherokee Singing Book. A Cherokee typewriter ball was developed in the 1980s, followed by computer fonts that expanded writers' ability to publish in Cherokee. In 2010, a Cherokee keyboard cover was developed, facilitating more rapid typing.","Around 1809, Sequoyah was inspired by European written languages and began creating a writing system for the Cherokee language.

== Contemporary issues ==

After much public debate about Germany's perceived low international ranking in Programme for International Student Assessment PISA , some things are beginning to change. There has been a trend towards a less ideological discussion on how to develop schools. These are some of the new trends:
 Establishing federal standards on quality of teaching
 More practical orientation in teacher training
 Transfer of some responsibility from the Ministry of Education to local school

Since the 1990s, a few changes have already been taking place in many schools:
 Introduction of bilingual education in some subjects
 Experimentation with different styles of teaching
 Equipping all schools with computers and Internet access
 Creation of local school philosophy and teaching goals ""Schulprogramm"" , to be evaluated regularly
 Reduction of ''Gymnasium'' school years ''Abitur'' after grade 12 and introduction of afternoon periods as in many other western countries

They also say that potential access to a Selective school would allow gifted children of lower-class parents living in poor neighborhoods better educational opportunities than if they were confined to schools with the average pupil population of their neighborhoods.

Opponents of streaming have pointed out that countries that performed very well in PISA, such as Finland, do not stream by ability.

"Before the dissolution of Yugoslavia , the Republic of Croatia, after Slovenia , was the most prosperous and industrialized area, with a per capita output perhaps one-third above the Yugoslav average. Privatization under the new Croatian Government had barely begun when war broke out. As a result of the Croatian war of independence, the economic infrastructure sustained massive damage in the period 1991-92. In 1999, GDP growth has slowed after a period of expansion, and Croatia is facing a recession. This is due mainly to weak consumer demand and a decrease in industrial production. Croatia faces considerable economic problems stemming from: the legacy of longtime communist mismanagement of the economy; damage during the internecine fighting to bridges, factories, power lines, buildings, and houses; the large refugee and displaced population, both Croatian and Bosnian; and the disruption of economic ties. Inflation and unemployment are rising, and the kuna has fallen, prompting the national bank to tighten fiscal policy. A new banking law passed in December 1998 will give the central bank more control over Croatia's 53 remaining commercial banks. Croatia is dependent on international debt to finance the deficit. A recently issued EURO-denominated bond was well received, selling $300 million, which will help offset economic losses from the Kosovo crisis. Despite the successful value-added tax program, planned privatization of state controlled businesses, and a revised budget with a 7% across that board cut in spending, the government still projects a $200 million deficit for 1999. Western aid and investment, especially in the tourist and oil industries, would help restore the economy. The government has been successful in some reform efforts - partially macroeconomic stabilization policies - and it has normalized relations with its creditors. The recession that began at the end of 1998 continued through most of 1999 , and GDP growth for the year was flat. Economics/Inflation|Inflation remained in check and the kuna was stable. Structural reform has been lagging, however, and problems of payment arrears and a lack of banking supervision continue. The upcoming elections may take HDZ focus off of economic policy.

For pure Internet Protocol IP forwarding function, a router is designed to minimize the State computer science |state information associated with individual packets.<ref> cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Lawrence|title=The Next Generation of IP - Flow Routing|url= February 2015|date=22 July 2003 </ref> The main purpose of a router is to connect multiple networks and forward packets destined either for its own networks or other networks. A router is considered a layer-3 device because its primary forwarding decision is based on the information in the layer-3 IP packet, specifically the destination IP address. When each router receives a packet, it searches its routing table to find the best match between the destination IP address of the packet and one of the network addresses in the routing table. Once a match is found, the packet is encapsulated in the layer-2 data link frame for that outgoing interface. A router typically does not look into the packet payload, citation needed|date=June 2014 but only at the layer-3 addresses to make a forwarding decision, plus optionally other information in the header for hints on, for example, quality of service QoS . Once a packet is forwarded, the router does not retain any historical information about the packet. efn|The forwarding action can be collected into the statistical data, if so configured. 
The routing table itself can contain information derived from a variety of sources, such as a default route|default or static route that is configured manually, or routing protocol|dynamic routing protocols where the router learns routes from other routers. A default route is one that is used to route all traffic whose destination does not otherwise appear in the routing table; this is common&nbsp;&ndash;&#32; even necessary&nbsp;&ndash;&#32; in small networks, such as a home or small business where the default route simply sends all non-local traffic to the Internet service provider . The default route can be manually configured as a static route , or learned by dynamic routing protocols, or be obtained by DHCP .<ref> cite web|author=David Davis|title=Cisco administration 101: What you need to know about default routes|url= 19, 2007 </ref> A router can serve as a DHCP client or as a DHCP server.

Forwarding decisions can involve decisions at layers other than layer 3. A function that forwards based on layer 2 information is properly called a network bridge|bridge . This function is referred to as layer 2 bridging, as the addresses it uses to forward the traffic are layer 2 addresses e.g. MAC address es on Ethernet .
Yet another function a router performs is called policy-based routing where special rules are constructed to override the rules derived from the routing table when a packet forwarding decision is made.<ref> cite book|author=Diane Teare|title=Implementing Cisco IP Routing ROUTE : Foundation Learning Guide|pages=330&ndash;334|publisher= Cisco Press |date=Mar 2013|chapter=Chapter 5: Implementing Path Control </ref>
Besides making a decision as to which interface a packet is forwarded to, which is handled primarily via the routing table, a router also has to manage congestion when packets arrive at a rate higher than the router can process. Three policies commonly used in the Internet are tail drop , random early detection RED , and weighted random early detection WRED . Tail drop is the simplest and most easily implemented; the router simply drops packets once the length of the queue exceeds the size of the buffers in the router. RED probabilistically drops datagrams early when the queue exceeds a pre-configured portion of the buffer, until a pre-determined max, when it becomes tail drop. WRED requires a weight on the average queue size to act upon when the traffic is about to exceed the pre-configured size, so that short bursts will not trigger random drops.
Another function a router performs is to decide which packet should be processed first when multiple queues exist. This is managed through QoS, which is critical when Voice over IP is deployed, so that delays between packets do not exceed 150ms to maintain the quality of voice conversations.
These functions may be performed through the same internal paths that the packets travel inside the router. Some of the functions may be performed through an application-specific integrated circuit ASIC to avoid overhead caused by multiple CPU cycles, and others may have to be performed through the CPU as these packets need special attention that cannot be handled by an ASIC.","The main purpose of a router is to connect multiple networks and forward packets destined either for its own networks or other networks.

In the fictional documentary 'Wesker's Report,' he reveals that he intended to sell the Tyrant to Umbrella's rival company as a means to gain a high position. However, his plan failed after the Tyrant was destroyed by his former subordinates. Wesker survived his apparent death in the first game by injecting himself with an experimental t-virus variant provided by William Birkin. This revived and augmented him with superhuman strength, speed, and regeneration abilities, but at the cost of his humanity. In 'Resident Evil Code: Veronica,' Wesker returned as a powerful agent for H.C.F., a Special Forces unit opposed to Umbrella. He orchestrated a raid on Rockfort Island to capture Alexia Ashford, who held the last sample of the t-Veronica virus within her body. During a confrontation with Chris Redfield, Wesker's orange eyes were seen for the first time. He took Steve Burnside's corpse to extract the t-Veronica virus and briefly confronted Claire Redfield in the expanded release 'Code: Veronica X,' but chose to spare her life.","Wesker's plan was part of an even bigger scheme.

Forty-five percent of human Somatic biology |somatic oncogenes seem to be regulated by bidirectional promoters - significantly more than non-cancer causing genes.

Certain sequence characteristics have been observed in bidirectional promoters, including a lack of TATA box es, an abundance of CpG islands, and a symmetry around the midpoint of dominant Cs and As on one side and Gs and Ts on the other. CCAAT box es are common, as they are in many promoters that lack TATA boxes. In addition, the Sequence motif|motifs NRF-1, GABPA , YY1 ,and ACTACAnnTCCC are represented in bidirectional promoters at significantly higher rates than in unidirectional promoters. The absence of TATA boxes in bidirectional promotors suggests that TATA boxes play a role in determining the directionality of promoters, but counterexamples of bidirectional promoters do possess TATA boxes and unidirectional promoters without them indicates that they cannot be the only factor.<ref> cite journal|doi=10.1101/gr.5623407|pmid=17568000|title=Transcription factor binding and modified histones in human bidirectional promoters|journal=Genome Research|volume=17|issue=6|pages=818–27|year=2007|last1=Lin|first1=J.

Although the term ""bidirectional promoter"" refers specifically to promoter regions of mRNA -encoding genes, luciferase assays have shown that over half of human genes do not have a strong directional bias. Research suggests that non-coding RNAs are frequently associated with the promoter regions of mRNA-encoding genes. It has been hypothesized that the recruitment and initiation of RNA Polymerase II usually begins bidirectionally, but divergent transcription is halted at a checkpoint later during elongation. Possible mechanisms behind this regulation include sequences in the promoter region, chromatin modification, and the spatial orientation of the DNA.<ref name=""dx"" />

"==Life and work== Baudelaire was born in Paris . His father, who was a civil servant in good position and an amateur artist , died in 1827 , and in the following year his mother married a lieutenant colonel named Aupick, who was afterwards an ambassador of France at various court s. Baudelaire was education|educated at Lyons and at the Collège Louis-Ie-Grand in Paris. On faking his degree in 1839 he determined to enter on a literary career, and during the next two years pursued a very irregular way of life, which led his guardian s, in 1841 , to send him on a voyage to India . When he returned to Paris, after less than a year's absence, he was of age; but in a year or two his extravagance threatened to exhaust his small patrimony , and his family obtained a decree to place his property in trust.

He took part with the revolutionary|revolutionaries in 1848 , and for some years interested himself in republican politics, but his permanent convictions were aristocrat ic and Catholic .

Bridge piers were constructed in 1992, but are damaged and have yet to be repaired. Since many reefs are around the island, and the surrounding water is too shallow, transportation and supply vessels are unable to dock with the island itself. Supplies are loaded on to rafts and taken to and from shore from an anchorage about convert|1.2|nmi from the island. Supplies are transferred with a safety load of 10 tons, and there is a high degree of difficulty due to the risk of large waves; rubber rafts carrying supplies and maintenance require time-consuming and difficult manual handling. fact|date=March 2016
