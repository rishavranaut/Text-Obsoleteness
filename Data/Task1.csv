old content:A pulverized coal-fired boiler is an industrial or utility boiler that generates thermal energy by burning pulverized coal, also known as powdered coal or coal dust, which is blown into the firebox. In 1929, the United States Shipping Board evaluated a pulverized coal-boiler on the steamship Mercer, a 9,500-ton merchant ship. The boiler heated with pulverized coal on the Mercer ran at 95% of the efficiency of its best oil-fuelled journey. Firing pulverized coal was also cheaper to operate and install than using oil as fuel. First steps towards using Diesel engines as means of propulsion were undertaken by the end of the 1920s.

old content:Thanatosensitivity is an approach to research and design that integrates mortality, dying, and death into user-centred design. It was first coined by Michael Massimi and Andrea Charise in 2009 as a humanistically-grounded approach to human-computer interaction (HCI) research and design. The term thanatosensitive comes from the ancient Greek personification of death, Thanatos. This inter-disciplinarity is crucial because studies of death and mortality are rarely amenable to laboratory study or traditional fieldwork approaches. Thanatosensitivity offers a non-invasive strategy for understanding conceptual and practical issues surrounding death, computing, and human experience.

new content:Thanatosensitivity is an epistemological approach that integrates mortality, dying, and death into traditional user-centered design methods. It was first introduced by Michael Massimi and Andrea Charise in their 2009 paper at CHI 2009.

The term thanatosensitive is derived from the ancient Greek mythological personification of death, Thanatos.

old content:The number of NGOs in the United States is estimated at 177 million. Russia has 277,000 NGOs. India is estimated to have had around 2 million NGOs in 2009, just over one NGO per 600 Indians. These diverse organizations share a common characteristic: their nonprofit status means they are not hindered by short-term financial objectives. As a result, they can devote themselves to issues that occur across longer time horizons, such as climate change, malaria prevention, or a global ban on landmines. Public surveys reveal that NGOs often enjoy a high degree of public trust, making them a useful proxy for the concerns of society and stakeholders.

old content:The Hunnic Empire was an empire established by the Huns, a confederation of Eurasian tribes from Central Asia. They appeared in Europe around the middle of the 4th century, overrunning the Alani and Ostrogoths, and defeating the Visigoths in what is now Romania. Their mass migration into Europe, led by Attila, brought great ethnic and political upheaval. The Huns' language was likely Turkic, although some theories suggest it may have been Uralic or Indo-European.

old content:In economics, a cost curve is a graph of production costs as a function of total quantity produced. In a free market economy, firms optimize their production process by minimizing costs consistent with each possible level of production, resulting in a cost curve. Profit-maximizing firms use cost curves to decide output quantities. There are various types of cost curves, including total and average cost curves, marginal cost curves, which represent the additional cost for each unit produced, and variable cost curves. Some apply to the short run, while others apply to the long run.

The first patent application for a round-frame human gimbal was submitted in July 1964. The aerotrim, as it is known today, was originally conceived by Helmut Suchy in the early eighties as a therapy for his ailing spine. Friends suggested its potential use in gyms and hospitals. Suchy built the first prototype in his garage but it lacked safety precautions, an adequate foot attachment mechanism, and was limited in height.

old content:Human activities, primarily the extraction and burning of fossil carbon from Earth's lithosphere starting with the industrial revolution, have disturbed the previous balance of the atmospheric carbon cycle and have been mostly responsible for the ongoing rapid growth in CO2 and CH4 concentrations. As of year 2019, annual emissions grew to 10 GtC/year, with a cumulative total of about 450 GtC injected into the cycle. The terrestrial and ocean sinks have thus far absorbed half of the added carbon, and half has remained in the atmosphere primarily as CO2. Assuming the growth trend in emissions continues, the CO2 concentration is on a path to at least double by the latter half of this century.

old content:As each episode of Inside No. 9 features new characters, the writers were able to attract actors who might have been unwilling to commit to an entire series. The cast includes Jane Horrocks as Liz, Nikki Amuka-Bird as Joanne and Tony Way as Michael, all volunteers at the call centre. Liz and Joanne have differing approaches to their roles, with Joanne focusing on detachment and Liz on involvement. Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. Jane's desk is adorned with various trinkets, which were Horrocks's idea and made viewers suspicious of her from the start. Horrocks was chosen for her ability to add humour while keeping to the tight timings necessary for the episode. Many of her lines were improvised. Michael begins working at the centre during the episode. Pemberton and Shearsmith considered mentioning that he had been sent by Pauline from Wood Green, a reference to the League of Gentleman's Pauline, but this was not included in the final episode.

The characters of Liz and Joanne have differing approaches to their roles, with Joanne focusing on detachment and Liz on involvement. Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. Jane's desk is adorned with trinkets, including ornaments and pictures, which were Horrocks's idea and made viewers suspicious of her from the start. Horrocks was chosen for her ability to add humour while keeping to the tight timings necessary for the episode; many of her lines were improvised. The character of Michael begins working at the centre during the episode.

old content:Critics warn that reclassifying puts too much emphasis on athletics over academics. Opposing players and parents who decide not to reclassify may resent the age gap. Reclassified students could experience reverberations from seeing their former classmates reach milestones ahead of them. Some states place restrictions on reclassifying. In California, public schools do not permit parents to have their child skip a grade for athletic or social purposes. The California Interscholastic Federation does not allow athletes to compete if they turn 19 before June 15 of their senior year. Louisiana public schools do not allow students to repeat sixth, seventh, or eighth grade for athletic reasons. In Maryland, public schools do not allow athletes to play after turning 19 or after having played four years. In Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association deducts a year of eligibility from athletes who repeat the eighth grade without a valid reason.

old content:An alluvial megafan is a large cone or fan-shaped deposit built up by complex deposition patterns of stream flows originating from a single source point known as an apex. Megafans differ significantly in size from alluvial fans. Due to their larger size, different geomorphic processes may have led to their formation. The distinction between megafans and typical alluvial fans is based on an arbitrary scale divide. This scale divide varies across literature, with the most common threshold being a 100-km apex-to-toe length. Alternative values range from as little as 30-km apex-to-toe length, and other metrics include coverage areas of greater than 10,000 square-km.

He was ordained as a priest and continued as an influential leader based in Birmingham. In 1879, he was made a cardinal by Pope Leo XIII for his services to the Catholic Church in England. Newman played a key role in founding the Catholic University of Ireland, which later became University College, Dublin.

old content:Walt argues that when other states view an emerging power as possessing certain qualities, they are more likely to see it as a threat and balance against it. The balance of threat theory modified realism by separating power from threat. In contrast to the balance of power theory, which assumes greater power reflects offensive intentions, Walt's theory suggests that states will not balance against rising powers unless they display aggressive intentions. For example, during the Cold War, the United States was more powerful than the Soviet Union but formed alliances with more countries because it displayed less aggressive intentions.

The balance of threat theory modifies realism by separating power from threat. Unlike the balance of power theory, which assumes rising power reflects offensive intentions, Walt's theory suggests that states will not balance against those with increasing power unless they display aggressive intentions. For example, during the Cold War, more NATO members allied with the United States than with the Soviet Union because the US displayed less aggressive intentions.

old content:Historical particularism, coined by Marvin Harris in the 1960s, is widely considered the first American anthropological school of thought. Founded by Franz Boas, it rejected the cultural evolutionary model that dominated anthropology until Boas' time. Each society is a collective representation of its unique historical past, according to historical particularism. Boas also rejected parallel evolutionism, which suggests all societies follow the same path and reach their level of development in the same way. Instead, historical particularism showed that societies can achieve similar cultural development through different means. Boas suggested that diffusion, trade, environment, and historical accident can create similar cultural traits. He identified three factors to explain cultural customs: environmental conditions, psychological factors, and historical connections, with history being the most important. Critics argue that historical particularism is antitheoretical because it doesn't seek universal theories applicable to all cultures. Boas believed that theories would emerge from collected data. This school of thought was uniquely American and Boas, arguably, the most influential anthropological thinker in American history.

Boas argued that societies could reach similar levels of cultural development through different means.

This school of thought was uniquely American and included Boas, who is arguably the most influential anthropological thinker in American history.

old content:Following the events of Odyssey Two and Odyssey Three, the Jovian monolith sent a report to its superior monolith 450 light years away. It was expected to receive orders regarding humanity after a nine-century round-trip. The monolith had the power to destroy Jupiter's nascent biosphere but needed higher authority approval for Earth's technological civilization. There was concern that the judgment, based on humanity up to 2061, would be negative and result in human destruction, similar to the Jovian bioforms discovered by David Bowman. Frank conscripted Bowman and HAL, now a single entity called Halman, residing in the monolith's computational matrix, to infect the monolith with a computer virus. The monolith received orders to exterminate humanity and duplicated itself, forming two screens to block Solar light and heat from reaching Earth and its colonies. However, due to Halman's infection of the first monolith, all duplicates disintegrated.

old content:Before the invention of printing, the Church controlled all opinion distasteful to her. With the printing press, German printers established themselves in western Europe, where copyists multiplied manuscripts. In 1473, Louis XI granted letters patent to Uldaric Quring, who had set up a press in the Sorbonne three years earlier. Paris soon had over fifty presses at work. The Church and universities found book output beyond their control. Pope Alexander VI restricted printing in 1496 and issued a bull against unlicensed printing in 1501. Between 1524 and 1548, the Imperial Diet drew up regulations, while France prohibited book printing under penalty of death. However, this was too severe, and the Sorbonne was given the right to decide, a system lasting until the Revolution.

old content:The California yucca moth (Tegeticula maculata) pollinates Yucca plants through symbiosis. The female moth collects pollen grains and forms them into a ball, then lands on another plant's ovary and inserts its ovipositor to lay an egg. As it rubs the pollen mass against the stigma, it ensures pollination, leading to seed production and a food supply for the larva. Tegeticula maculata has an exclusive relationship with Hesperoyucca whipplei.

new content:The California Tegeticula yucca moth, Tegeticula maculata, pollinates the yucca plant in a classic example of symbiosis. The female moth collects up to a dozen sacks of pollen grains and forms them into a massive ball. It then flies to another plant, lands on the ovary of a flower, and inserts its ovipositor into the wall, laying a single egg. The moth rubs its pollen mass against the central stigmatic depression, ensuring pollination. This process produces many seeds, providing an ample food supply for the larva. Tegeticula maculata has an exclusive relationship with Hesperoyucca whipplei.

old content:Several locomotive builders produced fireless engines throughout the 20th century. The Meiningen Steam Locomotive Works was still building them in the 1980s. Some fireless locomotives are in daily use even in 2021, such as those used at a large coal-fired power station in Mannheim where coal is delivered by rail in long trains of self-discharging hopper wagons. The power station uses three fireless engines to shunt the hoppers on its premises.

old content:Financial observers argued that market dynamics played a greater role than economic fundamentals in causing the crash and intensifying bond volatility over 1994. A report by the Bank for International Settlements found that a rise in money market instability corresponded with an increase in bond yield volatility. Japan was the first G7 nation to see bond prices drop in 1994, with domestic yields fluctuating rapidly just before the Fed's decision. The yen's appreciation exacerbated the destabilization of its money and bond markets, leading to nationwide deflation. Unlike Europe, Japan did not exhibit significant co-variability with the US in terms of bond yield volatility.

A report by the Bank for International Settlements found that a rise in realized money market instability corresponded with an increase in implied volatility for bond yields. This joint destabilization of Japan's money and bond markets was exacerbated by the yen's appreciation, which shifted expectations on consumer prices and short-term rates, leading to nationwide deflation. Unlike Europe, Japan did not exhibit significant co-variability with the US in terms of bond yield volatility.

The game also suffered from several technical issues and lacked some marketed features, including multiplayer. Hello Games has committed to fixing these problems and expanding the game's features over time.

A program by the Center for Connected Health and Partners Home Care has monitored over 500 heart failure patients remotely using simple devices in their homes to collect vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, and weight. The information is sent daily to a home health nurse who can identify early warning signs, notify the patient's primary care physician, and intervene to prevent potential health crises. A pilot of this program showed reduced hospitalizations. Another initiative uses cellular telephone technology and a 'smart' pill bottle to detect when patients miss medication, sending a signal that lights up an orb device in their home to remind them.

old content:The North American Dreamcast, which came with a controller and VMU unit, sold 10.06 million units. Unlike the expensive hardware of the Sega Saturn, the Dreamcast was designed to reduce costs using 'off-the-shelf' components, including a Hitachi SuperH SH4 CPU and an NEC PowerVR2 GPU. Initially released in Japan to a muted response, the console gained popularity in the US with a large marketing campaign. However, interest declined as Sony built hype for the PlayStation 2. Despite several price cuts, sales did not meet Sega's expectations, leading to significant financial losses. After leadership changes, Sega discontinued the Dreamcast on March 31, 2001, and shifted its focus to third-party publishing.

old content:The voting finally ended on July 9 with a declaration of independence. The Declaration pointed to the circumstances in Europe over the past six years, including the removal of the King of Spain by Napoleon and Ferdinand VII's refusal to accept constitutional rule both in the Peninsula and overseas. It claimed that Spanish America recovered its sovereignty from the Crown of Castile in 1808 when Ferdinand VII was deposed, dissolving any union between the overseas dominions of Spain and the Peninsula. This concept was also invoked by other Spanish American declarations of independence, such as Venezuela's (1811) and Mexico's (1810), which responded to the same events. The president of Congress at the time was Francisco Narciso de Laprida, delegate from San Juan Province. Subsequent discussions centered on what form of government the emerging state should adopt.

old content:Manhauling refers to pulling a load, typically in a sledge, using only human power. This approach aligns with Alpine climbing ideals of fast, free, and equipment-light travel. While purists aim for non-mechanically assisted progress, it's acceptable to use skis or ski sticks on snow-covered terrain. In extreme regions, equipment quality is crucial, but the goal is a balance between challenge and accomplishment. Pre-caching supplies or external help can compromise the purity of the experience. Manhauling typically occurs in polar, glacier, or snow-covered areas, although training may involve dragging sledges across sand or rough fields. Assisted manhauling involves using other sources of motive power, such as dogs or wind.

old content:Descriptive poetics is an analytic approach within literary studies. The concept of poetics dates back to Aristotle, but descriptive poetics refers to a middle ground between theoretically oriented approaches and analyses of individual works of literature. According to Brian McHale, the purpose of descriptive poetics is to provide exhaustive accounts of different kinds of objects, such as groups of texts, an author's entire production, or specific styles of literature. McHale argues that this approach is not defined by what it examines but by the level of generalization achieved in literary studies. The approach was formalized in the journal PTL: A Journal of Descriptive Poetics and Theory of Literature, which later merged with Poetics Today. Descriptive poetics was a prominent form of scholarship in the first half of the 20th century, especially in Germany, but has since been neglected due to its low level of theoretization.

Salaries below opportunity cost can induce civil servants to engage in potentially harmful coping strategies, such as seeking opportunities for own-account activities or asking for compensation through informal or illegal means, compromising the efficiency and honesty of civil service organizations.

The Chanson de Roland is an example of this, recounting the Battle of Roncesvalles during the Moorish invasion of southern France. As the genre evolved, elements of fantasy and magic were incorporated into the tales. The recurring figure Bayard, a magical horse, and Oberon, a fairy king, appeared in many stories. Sorcerers and wizards often served as villains, while heroes relied on magical relics for assistance.

old content:The Dreamcast was designed to reduce costs with 'off-the-shelf' components, including a Hitachi SuperH SH4 central processing unit and an NEC PowerVR2 Graphics Processing Unit. Released in Japan to a subdued reception, it enjoyed a successful U.S. launch backed by a large marketing campaign. However, interest in the system declined as Sony built hype for the PlayStation 2. Despite several price cuts, sales did not meet Sega's expectations, resulting in significant financial losses. After discontinuation on March 31, 2001, commercial games were still developed and released for the system, particularly in Japan. In the United States, game sales continued until the end of 2002. The console is still supported through various independent releases as of 2014.

old content:Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or MAOIs, are a class of drugs that inhibit the enzyme monoamine oxidase. This enzyme breaks down many compounds with a primary amine moiety. Important substrates include tyrosine and tyramine, precursors to dopamine. MAOIs can be reversible or irreversible. Reversible inhibitors temporarily bind to the enzyme, while irreversible inhibitors permanently bind and destroy it. The body takes about two weeks to regenerate its MAO enzymes after irreversible inhibition. There are two subtypes of MAO: MAO-A and MAO-B. Harmine is a mild psychedelic that increases the bioavailability of DMT by reversibly inhibiting MAO. Moclobemide is an antidepressant and anxiolytic that works by reversibly inhibiting both MAO-A and MAO-B, with a greater effect on MAO-A.

Reversible inhibitors temporarily bind to the enzyme, while irreversible inhibitors permanently destroy it. The body takes about two weeks to regenerate its MAO enzymes after irreversible inhibition. There are two subtypes of MAO: MAO-A and MAO-B. Harmine is a mild psychedelic that increases DMT bioavailability by reversibly inhibiting MAO. Moclobemide is an antidepressant and anxiolytic that works by reversibly inhibiting both MAO-A and MAO-B, with a greater effect on MAO-A.

This view agreed with Diderot's idea of progress, which concurred with Helvetius' elimination of errors but proposed expanding and creating new institutions. Diderot's psychology differed slightly from Locke's, as he saw the mind as active, forming general ideas before using them to create more knowledge and ideas.

It is this quilt that is now in the Smithsonian Institution. Jennie Smith, an artist and art teacher from the Lucy Cobb Institute, saw the quilt and asked to purchase it, but Powers refused to sell. The two women remained in touch, however, and when Powers met with financial difficulties five years later, she agreed to sell the piece for $5. Powers explained the imagery on the quilt to Smith, who recorded these explanations in her personal diary.

old content:Wai Chee Dimock, in the Los Angeles Review of Books, compares the film to themes addressed in James Fenimore Cooper's literary works. Dimock argues that Iñárritu remixes Cooper, turning the derogatory term 'halfbreed' into an existential condition yielding a new visual field. Dimock states that like Cooper's Cora Munro, Hawk is a halfbreed: the child of Glass and his Pawnee wife, who was killed during a US army raid. The epithet never appears in the film, but it does appear frequently in Cooper, notably in The Prairie (1827), which comes immediately after The Last of the Mohicans. In that novel, Cooper felt called upon to add a footnote: 'Halfbreeds: men born of Indian women by White fathers. This race has much of the depravity of civilization without the virtues of the savage.' Iñárritu clearly has other ideas.

old content:The GVU focuses on large, internationally active release groups that reproduce and distribute copyrighted products systematically for profit. It accesses public registers to reveal real people behind shell companies, if possible. Due to its private-sector activity, the GVU cannot directly identify IP addresses but directs evidence to relevant authorities as part of criminal procedures. This often leads to public prosecutorial investigations, with association employees acting as expert witnesses in some cases. Not every complaint results in successful prosecution; for example, the GVU made three applications against Kino.to before a case was opened.

old content:When adequate practice and feedback follow demonstrations, increased skill performance and learning occur. A study by Lewis (1974) observed children with a fear of swimming and found that modelling and practicing swimming skills improved their overall performance. The experiment lasted nine days and consisted of several steps. Children were first assessed for anxiety and swimming skills, then divided into three groups: a control group watching unrelated videos, a peer mastery group watching confident peers, and a peer coping group watching peers who overcame low confidence. After each exposure, children were reassessed. Follow-up assessments showed that the model groups had higher success rates because they perceived the models as informational and motivational.

old content:Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are the most commonly implicated microorganisms in the development of tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA). The pathogen spreads from the cervix to the endometrium, through the salpinx, into the peritoneal cavity, forming the TOA with pelvic peritonitis. In some cases, infection of the lymphatic system can occur, particularly with an intrauterine device (IUD) in place. Bacteria recovered from TOAs include Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus, and aerobic streptococci. Long-term IUD use is associated with an increased risk of developing a TOA.

old content:The entropy of a discrete random variable is a measure of the amount of uncertainty associated with its value when only its distribution is known. If the distribution is constant, then entropy is minimal and equal to 0. In contrast, if the distribution takes on a finite number of values, entropy is maximized with a uniform distribution over those values.

new content:Entropy information theory, or entropy, of a discrete random variable X is a measure of the amount of uncertainty associated with the value of X when only its distribution is known.

old content:The official name for this line is the Moorgate Line, however it is rarely referred to as this because of confusion with another line.

old content:In the theatre community, there is debate about the characteristics of an 11 o'clock number. It often signifies a moment of revelation or change in heart for a lead character, although exceptions exist. The 11 o'clock number differs from the finale as it's not the final number in the show, but this isn't considered a requirement by all. Broadway producer Jack Viertel defines an 11 o'clock number as 'a final star turn'.

old content:The term 'collegiate institute' originally referred to a distinct type of secondary school in several provinces in Canada. It has since become a synonym for an institution providing secondary education, particularly prominent in Ontario. However, it was also used in Western Canada, with Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan adopting Ontario's parallel school system in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. After the parallel system ended, most institutions were closed or renamed, but some continue to use the term, such as Lethbridge Collegiate Institute in Alberta; Mennonite Brethren Collegiate Institute in Manitoba; and Prince Albert Collegiate Institute in Saskatchewan. In Saskatoon and Regina, the term survives as 'Collegiate', found in public secondary schools' names. In contrast, most of Saskatchewan uses 'High School'. Quebec also uses similar phrases like 'collège' to refer to secondary schools.

old content:He is an average person, suited with cyclist equipment, fighting against odds he has no chance surviving. He is famous for traveling with his bicycle named 'Justice' as a weapon. He acknowledges Saitama's true power and is one of the few who does. Despite being useless, his popularity and devotion have gained him top rank in C-Class. He was at the same school as Saitama when they were beaten up by bullies during the Piggy Bacon side story. During that period, he began acting like a hero, calling himself 'Nameless Bicycle Commuter'. He attempted to stop delinquents who took people's money but was beaten up by them. Although he could rank up to B-Class, he decided to remain C-Class because he doesn't feel ready yet. Licenseless Rider makes his first appearance when the Paradise Group causes havoc in the city streets, trying to oppose the group but being beaten down instantly. When J-City is attacked by seafolk, he decides to run into it despite orders from headquarters to retreat. He fights the Sea King to save Genos and buys time for Saitama to arrive. Later, after Saitama is promoted to B-Class, Licenseless Rider meets him at an oden shop and thanks him for saving his life. In the anime, he appears at Hero Association headquarters in A-City during the Dark Matter Thieves' invasion, helping with rescuing operations with Lightning Max and Stinger. He reappears as one of Garou's 'hero hunt' targets; before they can start a battle, Tanktop Master challenges Garou after the Tanktop Fighters arrive to avenge their leader. During the fight between Tanktop Master and Garou, Licenseless Rider stops him from finishing off Garou, saying that a S-Class hero shouldn't go this far against a simple punk. After Garou defeats Tanktop Master with a powerful counterattack, Licenseless Rider and the Tanktop Fighters try to fight him but are quickly beaten. At the hospital, he is put in the same room as Tanktop Master and visited by Saitama, discussing what Garou means to Saitama. His original name refers to Kamen Rider.

old content:By the late 1950s, poultry production had changed dramatically. Large farms and packing plants could grow birds by the tens of thousands. Chickens were sent to slaughterhouses for butchering and processing into prepackaged commercial products that could be frozen or shipped fresh to markets or wholesalers. Meat-type chickens now grow to market weight in six to seven weeks, compared to three times as long just fifty years ago. This rapid growth is due to genetic selection and nutritional modifications, not the use of growth hormones, which are illegal for poultry in the US and many other countries. Chicken was once a meat consumed only occasionally but has become common in developed nations due to its availability and lower cost. Growing concerns over red meat's cholesterol content in the 1980s and 1990s further increased chicken consumption.

old content:As of March 20, 2016, Grimsby has grossed $5.9 million in North America and $16.7 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $22.6 million, against a budget of $35 million. In the United States and Canada, the film opened on March 11, 2016, alongside 10 Cloverfield Lane, The Young Messiah, and The Perfect Match. It was originally projected to gross $7-8 million in its opening weekend, but after grossing just $1.2 million on its first day, estimates were lowered to $3-4 million. The film ended up grossing $3.3 million in its opening weekend, finishing 8th at the box office. Forbes attributed the film's poor opening to its British content and marketing tactics alienating American audiences, much like Eddie the Eagle several weeks prior. Deadline.com added that some possibly saw the film as Baron Cohen 'doing the same shtick.' Sony Pictures' distribution head said, 'We certainly wanted more... we tried to crack the code on it, but it just didn't happen for us.' After its opening weekend, the film was deemed a box office bomb by numerous publications.

old content:The happy hunting ground was a concept of the afterlife given to several Native American tribes, including the Sioux nations. They believed that after death, the spirit went to this place unless they were scalped during their lifetime. This belief corresponds with the general idea that everything has a spirit, including trees, rocks, rivers, and natural entities. The existence of an afterlife was a key part of Native American spirituality, which included spiritual dances like the Sun Dance and Ghost Dance. These dances referred to the spirits of the dead returning to life. The name 'happy hunting ground' describes the features of the Sioux afterlife, where buffalo hunting would be a key activity, as it was an integral part of their lives.

old content:In 1929, the Providence F.C. hosted Bethlehem Steel F.C. under powerful floodlights at their stadium in Rhode Island. This innovation was initially met with resistance from the Football League, which eventually relented in the 1950s due to the growing popularity of floodlit friendlies.

old content:Modern thermostat control was developed in the 1830s by Andrew Ure, a Scottish chemist who invented the bimetallic thermostat. The textile mills of the time needed a constant and steady temperature to operate optimally, so Ure designed the bimetallic thermostat that would bend as one metal expanded with increased temperature and cut off energy supply. In 1883, Warren S. Johnson of Wisconsin invented the first electric room thermostat. Albert Butz patented the electric thermostat in 1886.

This position was held by Herbert W. Armstrong from 1934 to 1986 and then by Joseph W. Tkach until his death in 1995.

old content:While acknowledging that today's scientists who look for expressions of the concept of race in biology are not equivalent to their 19th-century peers, Saini questions whether this line of inquiry produces any useful findings. She argues that a focus on race or ethnicity in public health and medicine can blind researchers to causes proven to affect health outcomes, such as socioeconomic conditions. By rehashing the idea that the concept of race corresponds to actual genetic differences, it feeds the re-emergence of the white nationalist movement.

old content:In Major League Baseball, a club option is an optional year at the end of the ballplayer's contract that may be guaranteed by the team. The option often comes with a buyout, which represents a fraction of its value. If the team decides not to exercise the option, they usually pay the buyout and decline it. This typically makes the ballplayer eligible to become a free agent. Alternatively, if an arbitration-eligible season is turned into an option season, the team can decline the option, and the ballplayer enters the arbitration process instead.

old content:The influence of violent music on aggression towards women is significant, with misogynistic views commonly found in media. Research by Nagayama Hall (1995) and Felson (1996) suggests that exposure to such content can contribute to aggressive behavior against women. A study by Cooper (1985) analyzed popular music over 30 years and found a trend of describing women in terms of physical attributes or as possessions of men. Dietz's work (1998) also highlights the association between masculinity and sexual aggression.

new content:The influence of violent music on aggression towards women is a common theme in misogynistic messages found in media. Research suggests that exposure to such content can contribute to aggressive behavior against women. Studies have shown that popular music often portrays women in a negative light, describing them in terms of physical attributes or as evil, possessions of men, or dependent upon men. This perpetuates the concept of masculinity being associated with sexual aggression.

The yen's appreciation exacerbated the destabilization of its money and bond markets, leading to nationwide deflation.

The Arabian Nights tales, including 'The City of Brass' and 'The Three Apples', use non-linear narratives with flashback techniques. Similarly, the medieval English poem Beowulf uses a non-linear structure to focus on events throughout the titular character's life rather than presenting them in a linear narrative.

old content:PA 147 begins an interchange with US 22/US 322 south of the Clarks Ferry Bridge over the Susquehanna River in Reed Township, Dauphin County. The highway crosses the Appalachian Trail at this point. From the interchange, PA 147 heads northeast on South River Road between the Susquehanna River and Peters Mountain. The road passes through Inglenook and continues north away from the mountain, passing over railroad tracks. PA 147 then turns east and curves northeast into a mix of farm fields and woodland with some homes. The route crosses into Halifax Township and continues through rural land with some development, curving east to intersect with PA 225. At this point, PA 147 becomes concurrent with PA 225 on Peters Mountain Road. The road gains a center left-turn lane and heads north through rural areas of homes and businesses. The two routes continue into the borough of Halifax and become South 4th Street, losing the center left-turn lane. PA 147 splits from PA 225 by heading west on Market Street, continuing through residential areas. The route turns north onto North 2nd Street and leaves Halifax for Halifax Township again, passing more development before becoming North River Road. PA 147 then heads to the east of the Susquehanna River and the Buffalo Line, bending northwest and continuing through a mix of farmland and woods with some homes and commercial development. The road enters Upper Paxton Township, curving to the northeast.

old content:Social Dominance Theory describes human society as being shaped by group conflict and social hierarchies, which exist because they were necessary for survival. The theory explains how these hierarchies are maintained through various mechanisms, including aggregated individual discrimination, institutional discrimination, systematic terror, behavioral asymmetry, self-handicapping, and ideological asymmetry. These processes are driven by legitimizing myths, such as paternalistic, reciprocal, and sacred myths. For example, the Western idea of meritocracy is considered a legitimizing myth, as it creates an illusion of fairness while actually perpetuating social dominance.

new content:Social Dominance Theory describes human society as being shaped by group conflict and social hierarchies. These hierarchies exist because they were necessary for survival, but they also lead to oppression through various mechanisms.

The theory identifies three basic forms of discrimination:

1. Aggregated individual discrimination: ordinary discrimination
2. Aggregated institutional discrimination: discrimination by governmental and business institutions
3. Systematic Terror: police violence, death squads, etc.

Additionally, it highlights the role of legitimizing myths in maintaining social dominance. These myths include paternalistic, reciprocal, and sacred beliefs that justify the existing power structure.

The theory suggests that the Western idea of meritocracy is an example of a legitimizing myth, as it creates an illusion of fairness while actually perpetuating inequality.

old content:Hydroxyl tagging velocimetry (HTV) is a method used in humid air flows to measure velocity. It's often used in high-speed combusting flows because its advantages are accentuated by high velocity and temperature. HTV uses a laser to dissociate water into H + OH, creating a grid of higher hydroxyl concentrations. Another laser beam is passed through the flow, tuned to cause hydroxyl molecules to fluoresce in the UV spectrum. The fluorescence is captured by a CCD camera. By comparing images taken at different times, the displacement of the grid can be determined, allowing for calculation of the two-dimensional velocity field.

old content:Radiohead, an English alternative rock band formed in 1985, has performed and recorded numerous unreleased tracks since their formation. The song 'True Love Waits' dates back to at least 1995 and was occasionally performed live. A live version of the song was released on the album 'I Might Be Wrong' in 2001. Rolling Stone described 'True Love Waits' as a haunting exploration of dependence and desperation, and one of Radiohead's greatest unreleased songs. The band has struggled to record the song due to its elusive nature, with producer Nigel Godrich stating that they tried countless times but it never worked. Radiohead also performed 'Lift' regularly during their 'The Bends' tour, describing it as an anthemic Britpop hook before embarking on a darker path with 'OK Computer'. The band has revisited and reworked 'Lift' for possible inclusion on future albums.

old content:Due to Ancient Rome's focus on infantry and discipline, war elephants were rarely used. The Romans eventually adopted them, using them occasionally after the Punic wars, especially during the conquest of Greece. They fell out of use by Claudius' time, but were later used for demoralizing enemies rather than tactical purposes. Unlike other states, there is no evidence that the Romans used elephants to haul supplies. War elephants featured in Roman campaigns against the Celtiberians and Gauls. The Romans famously used a war elephant in Caesar's invasion of Britain, with one ancient writer recording that 'Caesar had one large elephant equipped with armor and carrying archers and slingers.' However, this may have been confused with Claudius' final conquest of Britain. An elephantine skeleton found in England was initially misidentified as these elephants, but later dating proved it to be a mammoth skeleton from the Stone Age.

old content:Open government is a political doctrine that holds governments and state administration should be open to public scrutiny and oversight. This approach is widely seen as a key hallmark of contemporary democratic practice, often linked to freedom of information legislation. Freedom of Information Acts have proliferated since the first passed in the USA in 1966. The idea that governments should be open dates back to the Enlightenment when many philosophers made an attack on state secrecy a core part of their intellectual project. Today, non-governmental organisations like Transparency International and the Open Society Institute advocate for norms of openness and transparency across the globe. They argue that civil society offers the best route to more transparent administration, pointing to the role of whistleblowers and an independent press as guarantors of transparency.

old content:MegaCity One's population lives in gigantic towers known as City Blocks, each holding some fifty thousand people. Each block is named after a historical person or TV character for comic effect. For example, Joe Dredd used to live in the Rowdy Yates Block, which was named after a character from the American TV cowboy drama 'Rawhide,' played by Clint Eastwood. The story 'Origins' revealed that MegaCity One was formed by urban sprawl rather than deliberate design. The city extends from Boston to Charlotte, North Carolina, but extended into Florida before the Apocalypse War laid waste to the southern sectors. At its height, the city contained a population of about 800 million; after the Apocalypse War, it was halved to 400 million. Following Day of Chaos in 2134, the city was reduced to 50 million. However, immigration quickly increased the population to 72 million by 2137. There are four other major population centres in Dredd's Northern America: Texas City, MexCity, Uranium City, and Canadia.

old content:Visible Learning was introduced by John Hattie in his meta study Visible Learning. He compared the effect size of many aspects that influence learning outcomes and found that most things work in education. The question is which strategies and innovations are effective, and where to focus efforts to improve student achievement.

old content:The voting finally ended on July 9 with a declaration of independence. The Declaration pointed to the circumstances in Europe over the past six years, including the removal of the King of Spain by Napoleon and Ferdinand VII's refusal to accept constitutional rule both in the Peninsula and overseas. It claimed that Spanish America recovered its sovereignty from the Crown of Castile in 1808 when Ferdinand VII was deposed, dissolving any union between the overseas dominions of Spain and the Peninsula. This concept was also invoked by other Spanish American declarations of independence, such as Venezuela's (1811) and Mexico's (1810), which responded to the same events. The president of Congress at the time was Francisco Narciso de Laprida, delegate from San Juan Province. Subsequent discussions centered on what form of government the emerging state should adopt.

old content:As of March 20, 2016, Grimsby has grossed $5.9 million in North America and $16.7 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $22.6 million, against a budget of $35 million. The film opened on March 11, 2016, alongside 10 Cloverfield Lane, The Young Messiah, and The Perfect Match. It was originally projected to gross $7-8 million in its opening weekend, but after grossing just $1.2 million on its first day, estimates were lowered to $3-4 million. Grimsby ended up grossing $3.3 million in its opening weekend, finishing 8th at the box office. The film's poor performance was attributed to its British content and marketing tactics alienating American audiences, similar to Eddie the Eagle several weeks prior.

old content:When Pat Mills developed '2000 AD' in 1976, he brought in John Wagner to develop characters. Wagner had written 'Dirty Harry'-style stories and suggested a character who took that concept to its logical extreme. Mills had previously developed a horror strip called 'Judge Dread,' but abandoned the idea. The name was adopted by Wagner with modifications. Carlos Ezquerra visualised the character, inspired by an advertisement for 'Death Race 2000' featuring David Carradine in black leather on a motorbike. Ezquerra added body armour, zips, and chains, which Wagner initially objected to. Mills rewrote Wagner's script and drew up the story with Ezquerra. The hardware and cityscapes were more futuristic than intended, so Mills set the story further into the future.

old content:The common disease-common variant hypothesis predicts that common disease-causing alleles will be found in all populations. Variations in the human genome, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), are common in independent populations and concentrated in coding and regulatory sequences of genes. These variations cause evolutionary neutral diseases and complex polygenic diseases by having a small effect on the disease phenotype, resulting in an additive or multiplicative effect of many susceptibility alleles. The hypothesis has been supported by studies on putative causal variants in apolipoprotein E (APOE ε4), which is associated with Alzheimer's disease, and IL23R, which is linked to Crohn's disease, with a 93% frequency of the at-risk allele in the general population.

old content:Factory farming in Britain began in 1947 with the introduction of subsidies to farmers for new technology, reducing reliance on imported meat. The United Nations states that intensifying animal production provided food security. By the late 1950s, poultry production had changed dramatically, with large farms and packing plants growing birds by the tens of thousands. Chickens could be sent to slaughterhouses for butchering and processing into prepackaged commercial products. Meat-type chickens now grow to market weight in six to seven weeks, compared to three times as long fifty years ago. This is due to genetic selection and nutritional modifications, not growth hormones, which are illegal in the US and many other countries. The common availability and lower cost of chicken have made it a staple meat product in developed nations. Growing concerns over red meat's cholesterol content led to increased consumption of chicken.

He divided the world into three leading states: the USA, Germany, and Japan, each controlling their respective regions. These leading states expected their regions to form economic and political alliances, yield to sanctions, and adopt cultural designations.

old content:The album was well received by critics and placed the band as forerunners to other eclectic hip hop performers like Urban Species, PM Dawn, The Fugees, and Outkast. However, their second album, lacking focused input from a record label, saw the band lose their earlier drive and promise, resulting in a creative meltdown. The album did not perform as expected. After a year of reflection, the band bought their own studio and slowly found the spark that was missing in the painful second album with renewed purpose. They were signed to Fontana/Mercury Records by renowned record executive Dave Bates, who had worked with Tears for Fears and Lloyd Cole and The Commotions. Their third album, Experience (1996), saw them work with rock producer Chris Hughes, who had also worked with Adam and the Ants, Page and Plant, and Tears for Fears. They released the self-produced single 'Pass The Vibes,' which became an international hit, particularly in France, where the group saw continued success.

old content:The most famous Palaeolithic settlement of Alby is located on the east coast of Oland, where excavations have revealed wooden huts around a small prehistoric lake. Excavations found evidence of bears, Marta, seals and focenids, as well as hunting and harvesting technologies such as spears, harpoons made of antlers and flint. Archaeologists discovered ringforts in later times at Eketorp. During the Bronze Age and Iron Age, tree species Stora alvaret suffered extreme pressure. Jannson suggests that deforestation caused a mysterious disappearance of humans around 500 BC, documented at Eketorp and elsewhere. It is believed that an expanding human population exceeded the carrying capacity of this site. Later, Viking settlements appeared in the periphery between 800 to 1000.

Harris died during an Alpha Phi Alpha hazing incident in 1989, Michael Davis died during a Kappa Alpha Psi hazing ritual in 1996, Joseph T. Green died during an Omega Psi Phi initiation ritual in 2002, and Kenitha Saafir and Kristin High died during an Alpha Kappa Alpha hazing ritual in 2002.

Although some believed Queen Victoria had only donated £5 to famine relief, she actually gave £2,000 from her personal resources. She was also patron of a charity that fundraised. In 1849, on the instruction of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Victoria made a propaganda visit under stringent security measures, which was not free from protests or controversy. The celebrations associated with her visit after the famine were compared to 'illuminating a graveyard' in a newspaper editorial at the time.

old content:Historically, an evangelist was a high-ranking minister in the Worldwide Church of God under Pastor General Herbert W. Armstrong from 1934 to 1986 and then Joseph W. Tkach until his death in 1995. Higher ranking positions included apostle and prophet as stated in Ephesians 4:11. The term 'evangelist' is no longer used as a ministerial title in the Grace Communion International, but some denominations with roots in the former organization still use it. Raymond F. McNair was an Ambassador Class of 1953 graduate who worked under Armstrong and held various positions including Deputy Chancellor of Ambassador College Bricket Wood, UK from 1960 to 1987. He later served as Regional Head in New Zealand, Fiji, Tonga etc before leaving the WCG due to major doctrinal changes and attending other organizations including the Church of God, a Christian Fellowship and the Living Church of God. McNair then became founder and president of the Church of God 21st Century and authored the book 'Ascent to Greatness'.

old content:The departmental model is an organization where departments and faculties of different academic subjects are separate and distinct. Each department, such as Math or Science, has its own head responsible for various aspects. Educators report to this head, who in turn reports to a higher administration, like a school or college, or directly to the main administration. Educational institutions using this model often provide traditional education, which emphasizes classroom forms and organizations that have been dominant since the late 19th century. This is reflected in educational facility design with separate faculty buildings on campus or standard classrooms and laboratories.

old content:The Football League reintroduced permission to play Friday night football, despite protests from pools companies. Colchester arranged ten games for Friday kick-offs, but it was the FA Cup that drew worldwide attention. United disposed of non-League Ringmer F.C. with a Crawford hat-trick in round one and completed a Cup double over new boys Cambridge United F.C. Colchester knocked out non-League Barnet F.C. at Underhill Stadium in the third round, only to be drawn away to Rochdale F.C. Trailing 3-1 with just five minutes left, United staged a remarkable comeback to earn a replay. With the knowledge of the Fifth Round draw having been made, United trounced hapless Dale by 5-0 to earn a home tie with mighty Leeds United F.C. on February 13, 1971. Leeds were top of the League and boasted ten internationals in their side, while Colchester were eighth in the Football League Fourth Division. Nobody gave the U's a chance, but they raced into a 3-0 lead, in front of a 16,000 Layer Road crowd, with goals from Crawford (2) and Simmons before Leeds generated something of a comeback to finally lose 3-2. The result was sensational as was the fact that United were in the FA Cup Quarter Finals. Sixth Round opponents Everton F.C. did their homework and Graham's 'Granddad's Army' finally succumbed to the tune of 5-0 in front of 53,028 at Goodison Park. While United finished sixth in the league, just two points off promotion, they simply had too many fixtures to complete in rapid succession as a result of the cup run.

old content:The most famous Palaeolithic settlement of Alby is located on the east coast of Oland, where excavations have revealed wooden huts around a small prehistoric lake. Excavations found evidence of bears, Marta, seals and focenids, as well as hunting and harvesting technologies such as spears, harpoons made of antlers and flint. Archaeologists discovered ringforts in later times at Eketorp. During the Bronze Age and Iron Age, tree species Stora alvaret suffered extreme pressure. Jannson suggests that deforestation caused a mysterious disappearance of humans around 500 BC, documented at Eketorp and elsewhere. It is believed that an expanding human population exceeded the carrying capacity of this site. Later, Viking settlements appeared in the periphery between 800 to 1000.

The Tipai-Ipai organized nine villages into a force of around 800 people to destroy the mission and kill three Spanish, including Padre Luis Jayme. However, not every uprising was violent. In September 1795, over two hundred natives deserted San Francisco in different directions. When uprisings occurred, the natives did not go unpunished: some Indians were put to death but many were imprisoned and forced into hard labor.

old content:The Palestinian Islamist political organization Hamas published a political program in 2017 to ease its position on Israel. The charter accepted the borders of the Palestinian state as they were in 1967, following the Six-Day War. Although this document is an improvement from their previous 1988 charter, which called for the destruction of the State of Israel, it still does not recognize Israel as a legitimate nation. In response to the new charter, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu labeled news outlets such as Al Jazeera and CNN 'fake news' for reporting that Hamas had accepted the state of Israel within their new charter. He stated that the new document says Israel has no right to exist. Haaretz fact-checked Netanyahu's video, stating that he was twisting the definition of 'Fake News' to serve his own needs. In a later speech, Netanyahu responded to allegations against him: The fake news industry is at its peak... Look, for example, how they cover with unlimited enthusiasm, every week, the left-wing demonstration.

old content:Albariza is formed by diatomaceous deposits and found in southern Spain. Boulbènes are fine siliceous soils that are easily compressed and common in the Entre-Deux-Mers region of Bordeaux. Calcareous soil is alkaline with high levels of calcium and magnesium carbonate, providing good water retention and drainage. It typically has cool temperatures, which delays ripening and produces more acidic wines. Calcareous clay soils have high limestone content that neutralizes natural acidity. Carbonaceous soil is produced through the anaerobic decomposition of rotting vegetation, including anthracite, coal, lignite, and peat.

old content:Historically, an evangelist was a high-ranking minister in the Worldwide Church of God under Pastor General Herbert W. Armstrong from 1934 to 1986 and then Joseph W. Tkach until his death in 1995. Higher ranking positions included apostle and prophet as stated in Ephesians 4:11.

old content:The Disney Princess franchise features beautiful princesses who are often married to handsome princes and served by others. Children's stories about these princesses can create unrealistic expectations, leading young girls to yearn for a similar life. As they grow older, this 'princess sickness' can make them self-centered and demanding towards others. An example of this phenomenon is the song 'Princess Syndrome' by Taiwanese singer Jay Chou.

new content:The Disney Princess franchise features ten princesses, from left to right: Snow White, Mulan, Aurora, Belle, Tiana, Rapunzel, Ariel, Cinderella, Jasmine, and Pocahontas. Children are often told stories about these princesses in picture books, where they are typically depicted as beautiful, married to handsome princes, and served by many people. These stories can inspire young girls to want to be a princess themselves, with some even dressing up like one to pretend. However, this can lead to an unhealthy obsession with being waited on and making unreasonable demands on others.

old content:Bang made his first appearance during the disaster of the giant meteor, one of the few S-Class heroes who responded to the call to stop the 'Dragon' threat in Z-City. However, he realized that the task was impossible for him to resolve and decided to stay in Z-City because it's his original city and he didn't want to abandon his family-owned dojo. He met Genos at the local Heroes Association and informed him about the current situation. Later, Bang followed Genos on a high building moments before the cyborg attacked the meteor. Since Bang was freaking out by the gravity of the situation, he calmed Genos with a wise speech. After Saitama destroyed the meteor, Bang acknowledged his true power with great surprise and protected Genos' exhausted body with his 'Water Stream Rock Smashing Fist' technique when the meteor's shreds hit the city. However, after understanding that the disaster was too huge and the building was about to collapse, he took Genos and left in a large jump. Bang made a small appearance on a roof when Tanktop Tiger and Tanktop Black Hole were trying to break Saitama, watching from outside. He noted that Saitama, like all heroes, will have to bear this hatred even for their beneficial actions. He then left Saitama to resolve the problem on his own.

old content:A pulverized coal-fired boiler is an industrial or utility boiler that generates thermal energy by burning pulverized coal, also known as powdered coal or coal dust, which is blown into the firebox. In 1929, the United States Shipping Board evaluated a pulverized coal-boiler on the steamship Mercer, a 9,500-ton merchant ship. The boiler heated with pulverized coal ran at 95% of its best oil-fuelled journey's efficiency and was cheaper to operate and install than oil-fuelled ship boilers. This led to early steps towards using Diesel engines as propulsion means on smaller ships.

old content:Examples of fire doors include those that are activated by building alarm systems or local smoke detectors and must close automatically when signaled, regardless of power. If there's a power outage, they don't need to close immediately, but must be capable of automatic closing when given a signal from the building alarm systems or smoke detectors. A temperature-sensitive fusible link may hold fire doors open against gravity or a closing spring. In case of fire, the link melts and releases the doors, allowing them to close. Some airport luggage carts require holding down their handbrake switch at all times; releasing it activates the brake, assuming other braking system parts are working properly, causing the cart to stop. This is an example of a dead man's switch.

old content:Suspension of disbelief is the act of willingly putting aside critical thinking and logic to believe in something that is unreal or impossible, such as a work of speculative fiction, for the sake of enjoying its narrative. Historically, this concept originated from Greco-Roman theatre principles, where audiences ignored the unreality of fiction to experience catharsis from characters' actions and experiences. The phrase was coined by Samuel Taylor Coleridge in his 1817 work 'Biographia Literaria', describing it as a 'willing suspension of disbelief for the moment'.

old content:The second round of negotiations began six months after the first, on September 16, 1958, in Moscow. The Soviets had to carefully choose American films that were apolitical and aligned with their ideology yet appealing to audiences. After two weeks, the Soviet delegation still hadn't selected the American films they wanted to purchase. Johnston feared another failed negotiation, so he requested a meeting with Khrushchev on October 6. Three days later, a deal was reached. The Soviets proposed a 10:7 ratio of U.S. to Soviet films, and both parties would pay approximately $60,000 for the other's feature films. To promote Soviet films in the U.S., significant investment was needed, but American films were cheap to advertise due to their guaranteed box office success.

In contrast, the Lacy-Zarubin agreement of 1960-61 allowed studios in the United States to directly engage in negotiations with the Soviets rather than through the State Department.

old content:In economics, a cost curve is a graph of production costs in relation to total quantity produced. In a free market economy, firms optimize their production process by minimizing costs consistent with each possible level of production, resulting in a cost curve. Profit-maximizing firms use cost curves to decide output quantities. There are various types of cost curves, including total and average cost curves, marginal cost curves (the rate of change of total cost), and variable cost curves. Some apply to the short run, while others apply to the long run.

old content:A 'profit warning' is sometimes considered neutral, referring to an estimated improvement in results. Companies may issue such warnings to inform investors that profits will increase in the coming quarter. However, this term has been criticized for being misleading as it implies lower-than-expected or previously announced profits rather than a loss.

old content:Under the Scotland Act 1998, an ordinary general election to the Scottish Parliament would normally have been held on the first Thursday in May four years after the 2011 election, i.e., in May 2015. In May 2010, the new UK Government stated that the next United Kingdom general election would also be held in May 2015. This proposal was criticised by the Scottish National Party and Labour, as it had been recommended after the 2007 election that elections with different voting systems should be held on separate days. In response to this criticism, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg offered the right to vary the date of the Scottish Parliament election by a year either way. All the main political parties then stated their support for delaying the election by a year. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 moved the date of the Scottish Parliament general election to 5 May 2016.

The author must reference therapeutic equivalence prior to cost-minimization work. Since efficacy and tolerability are already demonstrated, a common denominator isn't required. However, the author can use 'cost/cure' or 'cost/year of life gained' for comparison. If efficacy and tolerability are proven, a simple comparison of 'cost/course of treatment' is sufficient for comparing two or more therapeutically equivalent treatments.

old content:Eclecticism plays an important role in critical discussions and evaluations, yet its meaning is often unclear due to its distance from actual artefacts. A simple definition of eclecticism as combining various influences is too basic to be useful. Eclecticism shares some similarities with Mannerism, which was initially used pejoratively, but unlike Mannerism, eclecticism never formed a distinct movement or style. It's characterized by its lack of a specific style. In music, eclecticism is popular among alternative and experimental artists such as Beck, Alex Ross-Iver, Jimi Tenor, and others.
